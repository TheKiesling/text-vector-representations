According to these estimates, 33% is a more\\nrealistic figure.\"\\n\\n   (I went out and bought LOTS of Bell & Weinberg this weekend... can\\nyou tell?)\\n\\n   Also, The Janus Report on Sexual Behavior (Samuel S. Janus, Ph.D.\\nand Cynthia L. Janus, M.D., John Wiley & Sons (pub), 1992) has the\\nfollowing:\\n\\nTable 3.14\\nHave you ever had a homosexual experience?\\n          Men.

This number is consistent with Kinsey, Pomery,\\nGebard (1953), Bell & Weinberg (1967, 1974), and Rice (1987) in the\\nfinding that 9% of the male population is actively homosexual, with\\nan further breakdown (Bell & Wienberg, 1978) of 4% exclusively so and\\n5% self-identifying themselves as \"bisexuals.\"\\n\\n   (pp 69, 70)\\n\\n   As for debunking Kinsey, the following article is an important\\nlesson for everyone to read:\\n\\nWas Kinsey a Fake and a Pervert?\\nby Philip Nobile\\n\\n     Far out on the grassy knoll of sexology, there is a cult of\\nprochastity researchers who claim that the late Alfred Kinsey was a\\nsecret sex criminal, a Hoosier Dr. Mengele, who bent his numbers\\ntoward the bisexual and the bizarre in a grand conspiracy to queer the\\nnation and usher in an era of free sex with kids.  \\n\\n     But what really riles these critics is Kinsey\\'s towerin~ cultural\\ninfluence.  His bestselling surveys-- Sexual Behavior in the Human Male\\n(1948) and Sexual Behavior in the Human Female (1953)-- tore the\\nsheets off the country\\'s erogenous zones and undermined midcentury\\nmorals.  His charts and graphs, based on detailed histories of 12,000\\nmen and women, demonstrated that practices generally considered rare\\nand/or \\'abnormal\\'-- masturbation, extramarital relations,\\nhomosexuality, and even barnyard bestiality, were as American as\\nstrawberry shortcake.  \\n\\n     Yet for a hard core of these heterosexual supremacists, aided and\\nabetted by Pat Buchanan and the religious right, the zoology professor\\nfrom Indiana University remains the evil genius behind the sex\\nrevolution and a target for character assassination.  \\n\\n     Judith Reisman, the prosecution\\'s expert witness at the\\nMapplethorpe trial in Cincinnati, is the leader of the anti- Kinsey\\nrevisionists as well as his Inspector Javert.  In 1983, during a radio\\ninterview with Pat Buchanan in Washington, Reisman accused Kinsey of\\nhaving been inolved in \"the vicious genital torture of hundreds of\\nchildren.\"  She speculated that he kidnapped and drugged ghetto boys in\\norder to carry out clandestine orgasm tests.  \\n\\n     Now, seven years later, Reisman has revived her charges in a\\ndifferent book, titled Kinsey, Sex and Fraud, just released by the\\nsmall and religiously oriented Huntington House in Lafayette,\\nLouisiana.  Her coauthor is Ed Eichel, a Manhattan psychotherapist who\\nhas invented a new style of intromission (\"the coital alignment\\ntechnique\") that supposedly triggers simultaneous orgasm with\\nconsiderable regularity and thereby increases compatibilty between the\\nsexes.  In the book Eichel contends that \"Kinsey deliberately cooked\\nthe gay stats because, being an oddball himself, he wanted to advance\\nthe \\'denormalization\\' of heterosexuality.\"  \\n\\n     If the authors are right, then the world- famous Kinsey Reports\\nare, as the introduction boldly asserts, \"the most egregious example\\nof scientific deception in this century.\"  And if they are wrong,\\nKinsey, Sex and Fraud is a shameful smear.\\n\\n     Despite the less- than- stellar credentials of Kinsey\\'s\\ndetractors, legends are not what they used to be.  Martin Luther King\\nmay have committed plagiarism.  Bruno Bettelheim slapped young mental\\npatients around.  Father Bruce Ritter, the founder of Covenant House,\\npreyed on runaway boys.  Closer to Kinsey, Masters and Johnson have\\nbeen disgraced for faking it in one way or another.  \\n\\n     So it should not surprise anybody that Kinsey, who filmed strange\\npeople having sex in his attic, may have had skeletons in the closet.\\nThe problem is that Reisman does not seem to have the intellectual\\nprowess to pull off the job.  \\n\\n     As a thinker, the woman is no Madame Curie.  The 55-year-old\\nformer songwriter for Captain Kangaroo has little professional\\nstanding, no current university position, and no peer-review\\npublications, though her creative 1983 resume was padded with phantom\\naccomplishments.  For instance, it listed a book as her own-- Take Back\\nthe Night: Women on Pornography-- that was actually written and edited\\nby others.  Then there is her Ph.D. in Speech Communication from\\nCleveland\\'s Case Western Reserve University.  Although Reisman has no\\nbachelor\\'s degree, Case granted her a master\\'s in 1976 and a doctorate\\nin 1979.  Her dissertation was on the commentaries of a local\\noctagenarian TV commentator.  But on the resume, Reisman gave this\\npiece of scholarship a fancy Hautes Etudes moniker-- to wit: \"The\\nApplication of Aristotelian and Systems Analytic Theory to Mass Media\\nEffects.\"\\n\\n     When Reisman burst into prominence on Buchanan\\'s program, it was\\nlove at first sight for Al Regnery, the outwardly anti- \\nporn head of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention in Ed Meese\\'s\\nJustice Department.  Regnery was a young law-and-order conservative and\\namateur social philosopher who wanted to help change the sexual\\nclimate of the United States.  \\n\\n     After Reisman\\'s sensational radio session, the sexual equivalent\\nof Joe McCarthy\\'s Wheeling speech, Regnery summoned \\nher to meetings to discuss mutual interests.  First he tried to shovel\\nher $800,000 for a quasi-Frankenstein study that was going to measure\\nthe brain chemicals of men and boys who looked at arousing\\nphotographs.  Guffaws on Capitol Hill killed the original proposal, but\\n$734,000 in govemment money went to Reisman anyway for plan B- a probe\\nof child images in the cartoons Playboy, Penthouse, and Hust\\nler.  (Incredibly, this grant surpassed the entire budget of the\\nattorney general\\'s pornography commission.) \\n\\n     When the overpriced and oversold project was completed in 1986,\\nit was immediately shelved by an embarrassed Justice Department.  That\\nspring, Regnery resigned from his post only days before the New\\nRepublic carried this admission that he had kept porno magazines\\naround the house.  \\n\\n     Notwithstanding the six-figure humiliation, Reisman went on to\\nscratch out a niche on the ioony right.  As the darling of the sex\\ncranks, she deplores subversive phenomena like shaved genitalia in\\nmen\\'s magazines and blames AIDS on gays.  Kinsey, Sex and Fraud is\\nReisman\\'s latest grasp for respectability.  Pat Buchanan, of course, is\\nputting his Krugerrands on Reisman\\'s ultimate vindication.  \"This book\\nis social dynamite,\" he says in a blurb an the front cover.  He\\nespecially liked the antigay parts.  Smacking his lips in his\\nsyndicated column, he declared, \"It may just blow the sewer cap off\\nKinsey\\'s monumental reputation, reestablish homosexuality as a 1-in-50\\naberration, expose the Gay Rights movement as a paper tiger, and even\\nput at risk the enormous sex industry built upon Dr. Kinsey\\'s\\n\\'research.\\'\"\\n\\n     The blockbuster charge at the heart of the cluttered and\\nrepetilive j\\'Accuse is that Kinsey was a sex-mad pedophile who\\nmolested little boys in Nazi-type experiments and recorded their\\norgasms in his male volume/ A similar charge was first recited at the\\nFifth World Conference on Sexology in Jerusalem in 1981 to no effect\\nbefore being recycled by Reisman for Buchanan in Washington in 1983.\\n\\n     Here is how Reisman and Eichel repackaged the Mengele business in\\nKinsey, Sex and Fraud:\\n\\n     Mengele-like \\'scientific\\' experiments on infants and children\\nwere the basis for Kinsey\\'s conclusions...  on childhood sexuality.\\n\\n     Somewhere and sometime in the course of the project, Kinsey\\nappears to have directed experimental sex research on several hundred\\nchildren aged from two months to almost 15 years.\\n\\n     This, of course, would implicate Kinsey and his team in\\npromoting, and perhaps participating in, the criminal activity.\\n\\n     In the opinion of this book\\'s authors, that is exactly how part\\nof Kinsey\\'s child sexuality research took place.\\n\\n\\n     Donning his psychohistorian\\'s cap and citing an FBI manual on\\nchild molesters as a guide, Eichel casually diagnoses Kinsey as a\\nhomosexual pedophile with the perfect motive for doing exactly as\\n \\n\\n     [Kinsey] placed himself in professional and nonprofessional\\npositions where he had access to young boys, such as Y.M.C.A.  camp\\ncounselor, boys\\' club leader, and Boy Scout leader-- activities he\\nkept up \\'during his college and graduate yeaers, and even after his\\nmarriage.\"\\n \\n\\n     As crude as his analysis seems, Eichel was more than happy to\\nelaborate even further in a recent phone interview.  \"If you\\'ve ever\\nbeen around boy- lovers, pedophiles, they are absolutely compulsive,\"\\nhe averred.  \"Everything in his life is directed at getting children.  I\\ndidn\\'t mention this in our book but the caption under Kinsey\\'s high\\nschool picture was a quote from Hamlet: \\'Man delights me not, no,\\n[sic] nor woman neither.\\' What do you think they were picking up on?\" \\n\\n     Before weighing what Reisman and Eichel pass off as proof of\\nKinsey\\'s sex crimes, something must be said about Kinsey\\'s scientific\\nmodus operandi.  He was a fiendish collector.  As a young zoologist with\\na D.Sc.  from Harvard, he collected 4 million gall wasps and 1.5\\nmillion related insects.  When he switched to sex exploration after\\nagreeing to teach a marriage Course at Indiana University in 1938, he\\nwas no less curious or acquisitive.  Nothing that mammals did in the\\nrealm of reproduction was foreign to him.  He compiled masses of erotic\\nmaterials including toilet wall inscriptions from male and female\\njohns that highlighted differences in sexual psychology and flms of\\nmating in 14 species of animals that showed an amazing similarity in\\noral eroticism.  \\n\\n     Naturally, the sexual response of children, the genesis of eros,\\nfascinated him.  It was impossible to understand the sexual behaviors\\nof adults without examining their origins.  And so with the fervor of\\nhis bughunting days, Kinsey collected information about kids, though\\neven his worst enemies-- until Reisman and Eichel-- refrained from\\nlinking him personally to his data on preadolescent sex.  \\n\\n     Kinsey said plainly in the male volume that he got information on\\nthe sex life of young boys from people who had sex with them: \"Some of\\nthese adults are technically trained persons who have kept diaries or\\nother records which have been put at our disposal.\"  Although he\\ngathered much boyhood data from the memories of his subjects and the\\nobservations of parents and nursery school teachers, he treated the\\ndocumentary materia! of the pedophiles as pure gold.  There was nothing\\nlike it in the literature.  \\n\\n     Kinsey\\'s main source, a 63-year-old govemment worker, was also\\nthe most unforgettable character he had ever met.  This man, whose\\nhistory took 17 hours to log, had sex with over 600 boys and 200 girls\\nas well as 17 of 33 family members including his father and\\ngrandmother.  A sexual hobbyist and passionate record-keeper, he gave\\nKinsey detailed accounts of orgasms that he observed in preadolescent\\nboys.  Relying on the man\\'s meticulous research, which involved\\nfollowing some boys for as long as 16 years, Kinsey was able to\\nidentify for the first time six distinct types of male orgasm-- some\\nof which involved violent contortions at the peak of release-- as well\\nas the speed and the capacity of climax.  \\n\\n     What Freud had only imagined about childhood sexuality, Kinsey\\nhad reported as fact.  Children were indeed erotic beings from the\\ncradle.  \"These data on the sexual activities of younger male provide\\nan important substantiation of the Freudian view of sexuality as a\\ncomponent that is present in the human animal from earliest infancy,\"\\nhe concluded without raising eyebrows in 1948.  \\n\\n     Then along came Judith Reisman.  Ignorng the legitimacy of\\nKinsey\\'s inquiry, she beheld the ghost of Mengele in Bloomington.  She\\nwas appalled by the thought of infant ecstasy and read torture in the\\nportrayals of prepubertal orgasm rendered by the government worker.\\nAnd she dared to say that Kinsey was a sex criminal.  \\n\\n     Well, was he or wasn\\'t he? Let\\'s go to the text.  There is no\\nevidence in Kinsey, Sex and Fraud-- no witnesses, no paper, noteven a\\ntrace of hearsay-- that implicates Kinsey in either planning or\\npartaking in child sex experiments.  After 12 years on the trail,\\nReisman has uncovered just two sources to back up her original charge-\\n- amazingly enough, Kinsey himself and Wardell Pomeroy, Kinsey\\'s\\ncoauthor on both reports, to whom Reisman has never spoken.  It turns\\nout that her whole case rests on a few passages in the male volume\\niand in Pomeroy\\'s 1972 biography titled Dr. Kinsey and the Institute\\nfor Sex Research.\\n\\n     After frisking every \"the\" and \"and\" in both books, Reisman came\\nup with what she believes are \"smoking\" sentences.  To establish\\nKinsey\\'s alleged role in the planning, she says that \"there is a hint\"\\nin the fifth chapter of the male volume that Kinsey \"directed\" the\\norgasm studies on kids.  She cites his tell-tale quote from a critic of\\narmchair psychoanalysis demanding that \"writers...test their\\ntheories...by empirical study and statistical procedures.\"  Then she\\ncombines this quote with Kinsey\\'s statement that some of the\\nobservations of his pedophile sources \"were continued over periods of\\nmonths or years until the individuals were old enough to make it\\ncertain that true orgasm was involved.\"  \\n\\n     Putting two and two together-- Kinsey\\'s empiricism and lengthy\\nexperimentation-- she arrives at her hint.  But realizing this dog\\nwould not hunt, she devoted but a single paragraph to Kinsey\\'s\\nsupposed planning before shifting to the issue of his personal\\ninvolvement.  As for the alleged participation, after poring over\\nPomeroy\\'s biography, Reisman found several hidden clues suggesting\\nKinsey\\'s likely hands-on approach to kiddie sex.  Here the chain of\\nreasoning is more complex.  She points out that Kinsey was interested\\nin clitoral measurements, collecting sperm and filming sex in his\\nattic.  Since Kinsey did indeed mislead Indiana University about the\\npurpose of his cinematography-- he said that he was filming \"animal\\nsex\"-- Reisman asserts that a \"similar misrepresentation may yet apply\\nto Kinsey\\'s child sex experiments.\"  Catch the \"may\"!\\n\\n     Reisman was also struck by Kinsey\\'s doubting Thomas attitude\\ntoward the never before recorded climax of female rabbits: \"Kinsey,\\naccording to Pomeroy, was the type of person who needed to see things\\nfor himself.  Pomeroy gave the example of orgasm in the female rabbit.\\nBecause he had not personally witnessed this event, Kinsey had\\ndifficulty in accepting its reality, even on the strength of testimony\\nfrom a distinguished scientist.  How then did Kinsey testify to the\\nactuality of orgasm in a 5-month-old infant from the mere \\'history\\' of\\na sex offender?\" (But, of course, he did not: he depended on their\\nrecords.) \\n\\n     From this fantastic alchemy of conjecture mixed with clitorides,\\nsperm, attic cumshots, and climax-in-cottontail has Reisman defamed\\nthe legendary Kinsey.\\n\\n     Paul Gebhard succeeded Kinsey as the director of the Kinsey\\nInstitute and now lives in retirement outside Bloomington.  Reached by\\ntelephone, Gebhard defended the pedophile connection and denied\\nReisman\\'s nasty imputations.  \"I don\\'t understand the resistance of\\npeople like Reisman to studying the sexuality of children,\" Gebhard\\nsaid more in exasperation than anger.  \"That is where sex begins.  We\\nwere happy to take data wherever we found it.  Even though pedophiles\\ncommit criminal acts, they are usually not violent folks.  They\\nwouldn\\'t be very successful if they were.  One of our best sources was\\na headmaster of a boys\\' school who maintained a kind of alumni club\\nand sometimes went to the weddings of his former students.  As for\\ndirecting experiments, that\\'s absurd.  We never told any of our\\nsubjects what to do.  lt was against our principles.  Almost all of the\\npedophile material was retrospective anyway.  Nor did we ever conduct\\nsex experiments with children ourselves.  That would have been highly\\ninappropriate.\"  \\n\\n     I asked Gebhard if Kinsey had ever seen a child in a sexual\\nsituation.  \"I think a mother once brought in a little girl who humped\\nher teddy bear and Kinsey watched it.\"  \\n\\n     As for Kinsey\\'s sex life, it is still shrouded in\\nconfidentiality.  He was married to the same woman for 35 years and\\nfathered four children.  Apparently, there are no huge sexual\\nrevelations, although rumors of homosexuality have persisted without\\nconfirmation through the years.  Gebhard took his boss\\'s history back\\nin the \\'40s, but he refuses to discuss what he knows.  \"We never\\ndivulge anything about anybody\\'s history, whether dead or alive,\" he\\nsays.  \\n\\n     Reisman said no to an interview for this article on the grounds\\nthat I had once worked for Penthouse-- not to mention the fact that we\\nhave been debating each other in various forums for the past five\\nyears.  In keeping with our contentious history, she took a swipe at me\\nin her book for continuing \"the Kinsey practice of euphemizing\\nincest.\"  My offense was using the biblical variant \"lying with a near\\nrelative\" in a 1977 article on the subject of incest.  As a synonym for\\nintercourse, \"lying with\" appears eight times in Genesis.  \\n\\n     Ed Eichel is a different story.  Though seemingly obsessed by\\nKinsey like his coauthor, he was friendly in long conversations.  He\\ntold me that he began to smell a big baised agenda in sexology when he\\nwas a student in New York University\\'s Human Sexuality program in the\\nearly \\'80s.  \"It was literally a gay studies program for heterosexuals,\"\\nhe says.\\n\\n     Around 1985, Eichel came upon Reisman\\'s critique of Kinsey and\\nthe conspiracy theory started to sink in: the sex establishment was\\nruled by a Kinseyan bisexual bund advocating the overthrow of the\\nheterosexual norm.  No wonder he was having such a rough time promoting\\nthe joy of simultaneous orgasm-- anything that enhanced sexual\\ncompatibility between men and women inevitably raised objections.\\n\\n     Eventually, Eichel exchanged philosophical fluids with Reisman,\\nand from this union Kinsey, Sex and Fraud was born.  Eichel\\'s main\\ncontribution to the book is discovery and analysis of a Kinsey\\nconspiracy that supposedly seeks \"the establishment of bisexuality as\\nthe balanced sexual orientation for normal, uninhibited people\" which,\\nby destroying the traditional family structure and normal sexual\\nbehavior, \"would open the way for the second and more difficult step--\\nthe ultimate goal of cross-generational sex (sex with children).\"  \\n\\n     When I pressed him for specific references to back up his\\noutrageous contentions, he said weakly, \"You don\\'t think Kinsey is\\ngoing to come right out and say that everybody is basically bisexual\\nand should have sex with kids, but this is implicit in the Kinsey\\nreports.\"  \\n\\n     Meanwhile, Eichel is demanding a congressional investigation of\\nKinsey and his data.  Perfect.  That\\'s just what the country needs-- a\\nHouse Un-American Sexual Activities Committee, looking under beds and\\nasking people if they are now or have everbeen a reader, a sympathizer\\nor-- God forbid-- a subject of Dr. Alfred Kinsey.\\n\\n\\n         Elf !!!\\n--\\nelf@halcyon.com  (Elf Sternberg)',\n",

       " 're: extended Ka bands.\\n\\nI recently bought a 2 band detector.  You guys must all think I\\'m\\nnuts, right?  Well, I did a little research into Ka usage in this\\narea and found out that Ka is not currently being used in this state\\nas well as surrounding states.  Here\\'s how I found out:\\n\\n- A cop friend who did spend time nailing speeders doesn\\'t even know \\n  what Ka is.  He\\'s heard of K, which is what they use here and I\\n  explained that Ka is used for photo radar etc.. He then said, yeah,\\n  \"Ka stands for K automatic\"... duuhh.  He then went on to say that\\n  plans were being made for getting laser guns as far as going high\\n  tech were concerned, but he didn\\'t know too much.\\n\\n- My 8 year old 2 band whistler was consistently going off at speed traps,\\n  even the real sneaky ones.\\n\\n- When I called the Escort Shop, they confirmed that Ka is not used here\\n  or in surrounding states.  They did claim that Laser was being used\\n  a lot here, which I was quite skeptical of.\\n\\nSo in the end, instead of spending a lot of money and/or waiting\\nmonths for a state of the art detector, I got a low priced, high\\nperformance 2 band Escort 2200.  Incidentally its performance is equal\\nto their top of the line model in X and K band detection.  I know that\\nEscort has been surpassed by other brands lately, but I\\'ve never fully\\nrelied on a detector and I was convinced that the Escorts would be at\\nleast quite good, which was good enough for me and my wallet.\\n',\n",

bell  weinberg   and rice  in the finding that  of the male population is actively homosexual with an further breakdown bell  wienberg  of  exclusively so and  selfidentifying themselves as bisexuals     pp       as for debunking kinsey the following article is an important lesson for everyone to read  was kinsey a fake and a pervert by philip nobile       far out on the grassy knoll of sexology there is a cult of prochastity researchers who claim that the late alfred kinsey was a secret sex criminal a hoosier dr mengele who bent his numbers toward the bisexual and the bizarre in a grand conspiracy to queer the nation and usher in an era of free sex with kids         but what really riles these critics is kinseys towerin cultural influence  his bestselling surveys sexual behavior in the human male  and sexual behavior in the human female  tore the sheets off the countrys erogenous zones and undermined midcentury morals  his charts and graphs based on detailed histories of  men and women demonstrated that practices generally considered rare andor abnormal masturbation extramarital relations homosexuality and even barnyard bestiality were as american as strawberry shortcake         yet for a hard core of these heterosexual supremacists aided and abetted by pat buchanan and the religious right the zoology professor from indiana university remains the evil genius behind the sex revolution and a target for character assassination         judith reisman the prosecutions expert witness at the mapplethorpe trial in cincinnati is the leader of the anti kinsey revisionists as well as his inspector javert  in  during a radio interview with pat buchanan in washington reisman accused kinsey of having been inolved in the vicious genital torture of hundreds of children  she speculated that he kidnapped and drugged ghetto boys in order to carry out clandestine orgasm tests         now seven years later reisman has revived her charges in a different book titled kinsey sex and fraud just released by the small and religiously oriented huntington house in lafayette louisiana  her coauthor is ed eichel a manhattan psychotherapist who has invented a new style of intromission the coital alignment technique that supposedly triggers simultaneous orgasm with considerable regularity and thereby increases compatibilty between the sexes  in the book eichel contends that kinsey deliberately cooked the gay stats because being an oddball himself he wanted to advance the denormalization of heterosexuality         if the authors are right then the world famous kinsey reports are as the introduction boldly asserts the most egregious example of scientific deception in this century  and if they are wrong kinsey sex and fraud is a shameful smear       despite the less than stellar credentials of kinseys detractors legends are not what they used to be  martin luther king may have committed plagiarism  bruno bettelheim slapped young mental patients around  father bruce ritter the founder of covenant house preyed on runaway boys  closer to kinsey masters and johnson have been disgraced for faking it in one way or another         so it should not surprise anybody that kinsey who filmed strange people having sex in his attic may have had skeletons in the closet the problem is that reisman does not seem to have the intellectual prowess to pull off the job         as a thinker the woman is no madame curie  the yearold former songwriter for captain kangaroo has little professional standing no current university position and no peerreview publications though her creative  resume was padded with phantom accomplishments  for instance it listed a book as her own take back the night women on pornography that was actually written and edited by others  then there is her phd in speech communication from clevelands case western reserve university  although reisman has no bachelors degree case granted her a masters in  and a doctorate in   her dissertation was on the commentaries of a local octagenarian tv commentator  but on the resume reisman gave this piece of scholarship a fancy hautes etudes moniker to wit the application of aristotelian and systems analytic theory to mass media effects       when reisman burst into prominence on buchanans program it was love at first sight for al regnery the outwardly anti  porn head of juvenile justice and delinquency prevention in ed meeses justice department  regnery was a young lawandorder conservative and amateur social philosopher who wanted to help change the sexual climate of the united states         after reismans sensational radio session the sexual equivalent of joe mccarthys wheeling speech regnery summoned  her to meetings to discuss mutual interests  first he tried to shovel her  for a quasifrankenstein study that was going to measure the brain chemicals of men and boys who looked at arousing photographs  guffaws on capitol hill killed the original proposal but  in govemment money went to reisman anyway for plan b a probe of child images in the cartoons playboy penthouse and hust ler  incredibly this grant surpassed the entire budget of the attorney generals pornography commission        when the overpriced and oversold project was completed in  it was immediately shelved by an embarrassed justice department  that spring regnery resigned from his post only days before the new republic carried this admission that he had kept porno magazines around the house         notwithstanding the sixfigure humiliation reisman went on to scratch out a niche on the ioony right  as the darling of the sex cranks she deplores subversive phenomena like shaved genitalia in mens magazines and blames aids on gays  kinsey sex and fraud is reismans latest grasp for respectability  pat buchanan of course is putting his krugerrands on reismans ultimate vindication  this book is social dynamite he says in a blurb an the front cover  he especially liked the antigay parts  smacking his lips in his syndicated column he declared it may just blow the sewer cap off kinseys monumental reputation reestablish homosexuality as a in aberration expose the gay rights movement as a paper tiger and even put at risk the enormous sex industry built upon dr kinseys research       the blockbuster charge at the heart of the cluttered and repetilive jaccuse is that kinsey was a sexmad pedophile who molested little boys in nazitype experiments and recorded their orgasms in his male volume a similar charge was first recited at the fifth world conference on sexology in jerusalem in  to no effect before being recycled by reisman for buchanan in washington in        here is how reisman and eichel repackaged the mengele business in kinsey sex and fraud       mengelelike scientific experiments on infants and children were the basis for kinseys conclusions  on childhood sexuality       somewhere and sometime in the course of the project kinsey appears to have directed experimental sex research on several hundred children aged from two months to almost  years       this of course would implicate kinsey and his team in promoting and perhaps participating in the criminal activity       in the opinion of this books authors that is exactly how part of kinseys child sexuality research took place        donning his psychohistorians cap and citing an fbi manual on child molesters as a guide eichel casually diagnoses kinsey as a homosexual pedophile with the perfect motive for doing exactly as         kinsey placed himself in professional and nonprofessional positions where he had access to young boys such as ymca  camp counselor boys club leader and boy scout leader activities he kept up during his college and graduate yeaers and even after his marriage         as crude as his analysis seems eichel was more than happy to elaborate even further in a recent phone interview  if youve ever been around boy lovers pedophiles they are absolutely compulsive he averred  everything in his life is directed at getting children  i didnt mention this in our book but the caption under kinseys high school picture was a quote from hamlet man delights me not no sic nor woman neither what do you think they were picking up on        before weighing what reisman and eichel pass off as proof of kinseys sex crimes something must be said about kinseys scientific modus operandi  he was a fiendish collector  as a young zoologist with a dsc  from harvard he collected  million gall wasps and  million related insects  when he switched to sex exploration after agreeing to teach a marriage course at indiana university in  he was no less curious or acquisitive  nothing that mammals did in the realm of reproduction was foreign to him  he compiled masses of erotic materials including toilet wall inscriptions from male and female johns that highlighted differences in sexual psychology and flms of mating in  species of animals that showed an amazing similarity in oral eroticism         naturally the sexual response of children the genesis of eros fascinated him  it was impossible to understand the sexual behaviors of adults without examining their origins  and so with the fervor of his bughunting days kinsey collected information about kids though even his worst enemies until reisman and eichel refrained from linking him personally to his data on preadolescent sex         kinsey said plainly in the male volume that he got information on the sex life of young boys from people who had sex with them some of these adults are technically trained persons who have kept diaries or other records which have been put at our disposal  although he gathered much boyhood data from the memories of his subjects and the observations of parents and nursery school teachers he treated the documentary materia of the pedophiles as pure gold  there was nothing like it in the literature         kinseys main source a yearold govemment worker was also the most unforgettable character he had ever met  this man whose history took  hours to log had sex with over  boys and  girls as well as  of  family members including his father and grandmother  a sexual hobbyist and passionate recordkeeper he gave kinsey detailed accounts of orgasms that he observed in preadolescent boys  relying on the mans meticulous research which involved following some boys for as long as  years kinsey was able to identify for the first time six distinct types of male orgasm some of which involved violent contortions at the peak of release as well as the speed and the capacity of climax         what freud had only imagined about childhood sexuality kinsey had reported as fact  children were indeed erotic beings from the cradle  these data on the sexual activities of younger male provide an important substantiation of the freudian view of sexuality as a component that is present in the human animal from earliest infancy he concluded without raising eyebrows in          then along came judith reisman  ignorng the legitimacy of kinseys inquiry she beheld the ghost of mengele in bloomington  she was appalled by the thought of infant ecstasy and read torture in the portrayals of prepubertal orgasm rendered by the government worker and she dared to say that kinsey was a sex criminal         well was he or wasnt he lets go to the text  there is no evidence in kinsey sex and fraud no witnesses no paper noteven a trace of hearsay that implicates kinsey in either planning or partaking in child sex experiments  after  years on the trail reisman has uncovered just two sources to back up her original charge  amazingly enough kinsey himself and wardell pomeroy kinseys coauthor on both reports to whom reisman has never spoken  it turns out that her whole case rests on a few passages in the male volume iand in pomeroys  biography titled dr kinsey and the institute for sex research       after frisking every the and and in both books reisman came up with what she believes are smoking sentences  to establish kinseys alleged role in the planning she says that there is a hint in the fifth chapter of the male volume that kinsey directed the orgasm studies on kids  she cites his telltale quote from a critic of armchair psychoanalysis demanding that writerstest their theoriesby empirical study and statistical procedures  then she combines this quote with kinseys statement that some of the observations of his pedophile sources were continued over periods of months or years until the individuals were old enough to make it certain that true orgasm was involved         putting two and two together kinseys empiricism and lengthy experimentation she arrives at her hint  but realizing this dog would not hunt she devoted but a single paragraph to kinseys supposed planning before shifting to the issue of his personal involvement  as for the alleged participation after poring over pomeroys biography reisman found several hidden clues suggesting kinseys likely handson approach to kiddie sex  here the chain of reasoning is more complex  she points out that kinsey was interested in clitoral measurements collecting sperm and filming sex in his attic  since kinsey did indeed mislead indiana university about the purpose of his cinematography he said that he was filming animal sex reisman asserts that a similar misrepresentation may yet apply to kinseys child sex experiments  catch the may       reisman was also struck by kinseys doubting thomas attitude toward the never before recorded climax of female rabbits kinsey according to pomeroy was the type of person who needed to see things for himself  pomeroy gave the example of orgasm in the female rabbit because he had not personally witnessed this event kinsey had difficulty in accepting its reality even on the strength of testimony from a distinguished scientist  how then did kinsey testify to the actuality of orgasm in a monthold infant from the mere history of a sex offender but of course he did not he depended on their records        from this fantastic alchemy of conjecture mixed with clitorides sperm attic cumshots and climaxincottontail has reisman defamed the legendary kinsey       paul gebhard succeeded kinsey as the director of the kinsey institute and now lives in retirement outside bloomington  reached by telephone gebhard defended the pedophile connection and denied reismans nasty imputations  i dont understand the resistance of people like reisman to studying the sexuality of children gebhard said more in exasperation than anger  that is where sex begins  we were happy to take data wherever we found it  even though pedophiles commit criminal acts they are usually not violent folks  they wouldnt be very successful if they were  one of our best sources was a headmaster of a boys school who maintained a kind of alumni club and sometimes went to the weddings of his former students  as for directing experiments thats absurd  we never told any of our subjects what to do  lt was against our principles  almost all of the pedophile material was retrospective anyway  nor did we ever conduct sex experiments with children ourselves  that would have been highly inappropriate         i asked gebhard if kinsey had ever seen a child in a sexual situation  i think a mother once brought in a little girl who humped her teddy bear and kinsey watched it         as for kinseys sex life it is still shrouded in confidentiality  he was married to the same woman for  years and fathered four children  apparently there are no huge sexual revelations although rumors of homosexuality have persisted without confirmation through the years  gebhard took his bosss history back in the s but he refuses to discuss what he knows  we never divulge anything about anybodys history whether dead or alive he says         reisman said no to an interview for this article on the grounds that i had once worked for penthouse not to mention the fact that we have been debating each other in various forums for the past five years  in keeping with our contentious history she took a swipe at me in her book for continuing the kinsey practice of euphemizing incest  my offense was using the biblical variant lying with a near relative in a  article on the subject of incest  as a synonym for intercourse lying with appears eight times in genesis         ed eichel is a different story  though seemingly obsessed by kinsey like his coauthor he was friendly in long conversations  he told me that he began to smell a big baised agenda in sexology when he was a student in new york universitys human sexuality program in the early s  it was literally a gay studies program for heterosexuals he says       around  eichel came upon reismans critique of kinsey and the conspiracy theory started to sink in the sex establishment was ruled by a kinseyan bisexual bund advocating the overthrow of the heterosexual norm  no wonder he was having such a rough time promoting the joy of simultaneous orgasm anything that enhanced sexual compatibility between men and women inevitably raised objections       eventually eichel exchanged philosophical fluids with reisman and from this union kinsey sex and fraud was born  eichels main contribution to the book is discovery and analysis of a kinsey conspiracy that supposedly seeks the establishment of bisexuality as the balanced sexual orientation for normal uninhibited people which by destroying the traditional family structure and normal sexual behavior would open the way for the second and more difficult step the ultimate goal of crossgenerational sex sex with children         when i pressed him for specific references to back up his outrageous contentions he said weakly you dont think kinsey is going to come right out and say that everybody is basically bisexual and should have sex with kids but this is implicit in the kinsey reports         meanwhile eichel is demanding a congressional investigation of kinsey and his data  perfect  thats just what the country needs a house unamerican sexual activities committee looking under beds and asking people if they are now or have everbeen a reader a sympathizer or god forbid a subject of dr alfred kinsey            elf   elfhalcyoncom  elf sternberg',\n",

Por otro lado, **Word2Vec** obtuvo un **76.07%**, mostrando que los embeddings capturan relaciones semánticas útiles, pero al promediar los vectores de palabras se pierde parte de la estructura contextual. Finalmente, **PPMI** alcanzó un **70.12%**, ya que si bien resalta asociaciones de co-ocurrencia entre palabras, su alta dimensionalidad y dispersión reducen su efectividad práctica en clasificación."

Y sobre todo **Word2Vec**  aprende representaciones densas y continuas donde palabras con contextos parecidos ocupan posiciones cercanas en el espacio vectorial, lo que le permite capturar sinónimos, analogías y similitud semántica de forma más natural que los otros dos enfoques."
