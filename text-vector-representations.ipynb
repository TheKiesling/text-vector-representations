Janus, Ph.D.\\nand Cynthia L. Janus, M.D., John Wiley & Sons (pub), 1992) has the\\nfollowing:\\n\\nTable 3.14\\nHave you ever had a homosexual experience?\\n          Men.

This number is consistent with Kinsey, Pomery,\\nGebard (1953), Bell & Weinberg (1967, 1974), and Rice (1987) in the\\nfinding that 9% of the male population is actively homosexual, with\\nan further breakdown (Bell & Wienberg, 1978) of 4% exclusively so and\\n5% self-identifying themselves as \"bisexuals.\"\\n\\n   (pp 69, 70)\\n\\n   As for debunking Kinsey, the following article is an important\\nlesson for everyone to read:\\n\\nWas Kinsey a Fake and a Pervert?\\nby Philip Nobile\\n\\n     Far out on the grassy knoll of sexology, there is a cult of\\nprochastity researchers who claim that the late Alfred Kinsey was a\\nsecret sex criminal, a Hoosier Dr. Mengele, who bent his numbers\\ntoward the bisexual and the bizarre in a grand conspiracy to queer the\\nnation and usher in an era of free sex with kids.  \\n\\n     But what really riles these critics is Kinsey\\'s towerin~ cultural\\ninfluence.  His bestselling surveys-- Sexual Behavior in the Human Male\\n(1948) and Sexual Behavior in the Human Female (1953)-- tore the\\nsheets off the country\\'s erogenous zones and undermined midcentury\\nmorals.  His charts and graphs, based on detailed histories of 12,000\\nmen and women, demonstrated that practices generally considered rare\\nand/or \\'abnormal\\'-- masturbation, extramarital relations,\\nhomosexuality, and even barnyard bestiality, were as American as\\nstrawberry shortcake.  \\n\\n     Yet for a hard core of these heterosexual supremacists, aided and\\nabetted by Pat Buchanan and the religious right, the zoology professor\\nfrom Indiana University remains the evil genius behind the sex\\nrevolution and a target for character assassination.  \\n\\n     Judith Reisman, the prosecution\\'s expert witness at the\\nMapplethorpe trial in Cincinnati, is the leader of the anti- Kinsey\\nrevisionists as well as his Inspector Javert.  In 1983, during a radio\\ninterview with Pat Buchanan in Washington, Reisman accused Kinsey of\\nhaving been inolved in \"the vicious genital torture of hundreds of\\nchildren.\"  She speculated that he kidnapped and drugged ghetto boys in\\norder to carry out clandestine orgasm tests.  \\n\\n     Now, seven years later, Reisman has revived her charges in a\\ndifferent book, titled Kinsey, Sex and Fraud, just released by the\\nsmall and religiously oriented Huntington House in Lafayette,\\nLouisiana.  Her coauthor is Ed Eichel, a Manhattan psychotherapist who\\nhas invented a new style of intromission (\"the coital alignment\\ntechnique\") that supposedly triggers simultaneous orgasm with\\nconsiderable regularity and thereby increases compatibilty between the\\nsexes.  In the book Eichel contends that \"Kinsey deliberately cooked\\nthe gay stats because, being an oddball himself, he wanted to advance\\nthe \\'denormalization\\' of heterosexuality.\"  \\n\\n     If the authors are right, then the world- famous Kinsey Reports\\nare, as the introduction boldly asserts, \"the most egregious example\\nof scientific deception in this century.\"  And if they are wrong,\\nKinsey, Sex and Fraud is a shameful smear.\\n\\n     Despite the less- than- stellar credentials of Kinsey\\'s\\ndetractors, legends are not what they used to be.  Martin Luther King\\nmay have committed plagiarism.  Bruno Bettelheim slapped young mental\\npatients around.  Father Bruce Ritter, the founder of Covenant House,\\npreyed on runaway boys.  Closer to Kinsey, Masters and Johnson have\\nbeen disgraced for faking it in one way or another.  \\n\\n     So it should not surprise anybody that Kinsey, who filmed strange\\npeople having sex in his attic, may have had skeletons in the closet.\\nThe problem is that Reisman does not seem to have the intellectual\\nprowess to pull off the job.  \\n\\n     As a thinker, the woman is no Madame Curie.  The 55-year-old\\nformer songwriter for Captain Kangaroo has little professional\\nstanding, no current university position, and no peer-review\\npublications, though her creative 1983 resume was padded with phantom\\naccomplishments.  For instance, it listed a book as her own-- Take Back\\nthe Night: Women on Pornography-- that was actually written and edited\\nby others.  Then there is her Ph.D. in Speech Communication from\\nCleveland\\'s Case Western Reserve University.  Although Reisman has no\\nbachelor\\'s degree, Case granted her a master\\'s in 1976 and a doctorate\\nin 1979.  Her dissertation was on the commentaries of a local\\noctagenarian TV commentator.  But on the resume, Reisman gave this\\npiece of scholarship a fancy Hautes Etudes moniker-- to wit: \"The\\nApplication of Aristotelian and Systems Analytic Theory to Mass Media\\nEffects.\"\\n\\n     When Reisman burst into prominence on Buchanan\\'s program, it was\\nlove at first sight for Al Regnery, the outwardly anti- \\nporn head of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention in Ed Meese\\'s\\nJustice Department.  Regnery was a young law-and-order conservative and\\namateur social philosopher who wanted to help change the sexual\\nclimate of the United States.  \\n\\n     After Reisman\\'s sensational radio session, the sexual equivalent\\nof Joe McCarthy\\'s Wheeling speech, Regnery summoned \\nher to meetings to discuss mutual interests.  First he tried to shovel\\nher $800,000 for a quasi-Frankenstein study that was going to measure\\nthe brain chemicals of men and boys who looked at arousing\\nphotographs.  Guffaws on Capitol Hill killed the original proposal, but\\n$734,000 in govemment money went to Reisman anyway for plan B- a probe\\nof child images in the cartoons Playboy, Penthouse, and Hust\\nler.  (Incredibly, this grant surpassed the entire budget of the\\nattorney general\\'s pornography commission.) \\n\\n     When the overpriced and oversold project was completed in 1986,\\nit was immediately shelved by an embarrassed Justice Department.  That\\nspring, Regnery resigned from his post only days before the New\\nRepublic carried this admission that he had kept porno magazines\\naround the house.  \\n\\n     Notwithstanding the six-figure humiliation, Reisman went on to\\nscratch out a niche on the ioony right.  As the darling of the sex\\ncranks, she deplores subversive phenomena like shaved genitalia in\\nmen\\'s magazines and blames AIDS on gays.  Kinsey, Sex and Fraud is\\nReisman\\'s latest grasp for respectability.  Pat Buchanan, of course, is\\nputting his Krugerrands on Reisman\\'s ultimate vindication.  \"This book\\nis social dynamite,\" he says in a blurb an the front cover.  He\\nespecially liked the antigay parts.  Smacking his lips in his\\nsyndicated column, he declared, \"It may just blow the sewer cap off\\nKinsey\\'s monumental reputation, reestablish homosexuality as a 1-in-50\\naberration, expose the Gay Rights movement as a paper tiger, and even\\nput at risk the enormous sex industry built upon Dr. Kinsey\\'s\\n\\'research.\\'\"\\n\\n     The blockbuster charge at the heart of the cluttered and\\nrepetilive j\\'Accuse is that Kinsey was a sex-mad pedophile who\\nmolested little boys in Nazi-type experiments and recorded their\\norgasms in his male volume/ A similar charge was first recited at the\\nFifth World Conference on Sexology in Jerusalem in 1981 to no effect\\nbefore being recycled by Reisman for Buchanan in Washington in 1983.\\n\\n     Here is how Reisman and Eichel repackaged the Mengele business in\\nKinsey, Sex and Fraud:\\n\\n     Mengele-like \\'scientific\\' experiments on infants and children\\nwere the basis for Kinsey\\'s conclusions...  on childhood sexuality.\\n\\n     Somewhere and sometime in the course of the project, Kinsey\\nappears to have directed experimental sex research on several hundred\\nchildren aged from two months to almost 15 years.\\n\\n     This, of course, would implicate Kinsey and his team in\\npromoting, and perhaps participating in, the criminal activity.\\n\\n     In the opinion of this book\\'s authors, that is exactly how part\\nof Kinsey\\'s child sexuality research took place.\\n\\n\\n     Donning his psychohistorian\\'s cap and citing an FBI manual on\\nchild molesters as a guide, Eichel casually diagnoses Kinsey as a\\nhomosexual pedophile with the perfect motive for doing exactly as\\n \\n\\n     [Kinsey] placed himself in professional and nonprofessional\\npositions where he had access to young boys, such as Y.M.C.A.  camp\\ncounselor, boys\\' club leader, and Boy Scout leader-- activities he\\nkept up \\'during his college and graduate yeaers, and even after his\\nmarriage.\"\\n \\n\\n     As crude as his analysis seems, Eichel was more than happy to\\nelaborate even further in a recent phone interview.  \"If you\\'ve ever\\nbeen around boy- lovers, pedophiles, they are absolutely compulsive,\"\\nhe averred.  \"Everything in his life is directed at getting children.  I\\ndidn\\'t mention this in our book but the caption under Kinsey\\'s high\\nschool picture was a quote from Hamlet: \\'Man delights me not, no,\\n[sic] nor woman neither.\\' What do you think they were picking up on?\" \\n\\n     Before weighing what Reisman and Eichel pass off as proof of\\nKinsey\\'s sex crimes, something must be said about Kinsey\\'s scientific\\nmodus operandi.  He was a fiendish collector.  As a young zoologist with\\na D.Sc.  from Harvard, he collected 4 million gall wasps and 1.5\\nmillion related insects.  When he switched to sex exploration after\\nagreeing to teach a marriage Course at Indiana University in 1938, he\\nwas no less curious or acquisitive.  Nothing that mammals did in the\\nrealm of reproduction was foreign to him.  He compiled masses of erotic\\nmaterials including toilet wall inscriptions from male and female\\njohns that highlighted differences in sexual psychology and flms of\\nmating in 14 species of animals that showed an amazing similarity in\\noral eroticism.  \\n\\n     Naturally, the sexual response of children, the genesis of eros,\\nfascinated him.  It was impossible to understand the sexual behaviors\\nof adults without examining their origins.  And so with the fervor of\\nhis bughunting days, Kinsey collected information about kids, though\\neven his worst enemies-- until Reisman and Eichel-- refrained from\\nlinking him personally to his data on preadolescent sex.  \\n\\n     Kinsey said plainly in the male volume that he got information on\\nthe sex life of young boys from people who had sex with them: \"Some of\\nthese adults are technically trained persons who have kept diaries or\\nother records which have been put at our disposal.\"  Although he\\ngathered much boyhood data from the memories of his subjects and the\\nobservations of parents and nursery school teachers, he treated the\\ndocumentary materia! of the pedophiles as pure gold.  There was nothing\\nlike it in the literature.  \\n\\n     Kinsey\\'s main source, a 63-year-old govemment worker, was also\\nthe most unforgettable character he had ever met.  This man, whose\\nhistory took 17 hours to log, had sex with over 600 boys and 200 girls\\nas well as 17 of 33 family members including his father and\\ngrandmother.  A sexual hobbyist and passionate record-keeper, he gave\\nKinsey detailed accounts of orgasms that he observed in preadolescent\\nboys.  Relying on the man\\'s meticulous research, which involved\\nfollowing some boys for as long as 16 years, Kinsey was able to\\nidentify for the first time six distinct types of male orgasm-- some\\nof which involved violent contortions at the peak of release-- as well\\nas the speed and the capacity of climax.  \\n\\n     What Freud had only imagined about childhood sexuality, Kinsey\\nhad reported as fact.  Children were indeed erotic beings from the\\ncradle.  \"These data on the sexual activities of younger male provide\\nan important substantiation of the Freudian view of sexuality as a\\ncomponent that is present in the human animal from earliest infancy,\"\\nhe concluded without raising eyebrows in 1948.  \\n\\n     Then along came Judith Reisman.  Ignorng the legitimacy of\\nKinsey\\'s inquiry, she beheld the ghost of Mengele in Bloomington.  She\\nwas appalled by the thought of infant ecstasy and read torture in the\\nportrayals of prepubertal orgasm rendered by the government worker.\\nAnd she dared to say that Kinsey was a sex criminal.  \\n\\n     Well, was he or wasn\\'t he? Let\\'s go to the text.  There is no\\nevidence in Kinsey, Sex and Fraud-- no witnesses, no paper, noteven a\\ntrace of hearsay-- that implicates Kinsey in either planning or\\npartaking in child sex experiments.  After 12 years on the trail,\\nReisman has uncovered just two sources to back up her original charge-\\n- amazingly enough, Kinsey himself and Wardell Pomeroy, Kinsey\\'s\\ncoauthor on both reports, to whom Reisman has never spoken.  It turns\\nout that her whole case rests on a few passages in the male volume\\niand in Pomeroy\\'s 1972 biography titled Dr. Kinsey and the Institute\\nfor Sex Research.\\n\\n     After frisking every \"the\" and \"and\" in both books, Reisman came\\nup with what she believes are \"smoking\" sentences.  To establish\\nKinsey\\'s alleged role in the planning, she says that \"there is a hint\"\\nin the fifth chapter of the male volume that Kinsey \"directed\" the\\norgasm studies on kids.  She cites his tell-tale quote from a critic of\\narmchair psychoanalysis demanding that \"writers...test their\\ntheories...by empirical study and statistical procedures.\"  Then she\\ncombines this quote with Kinsey\\'s statement that some of the\\nobservations of his pedophile sources \"were continued over periods of\\nmonths or years until the individuals were old enough to make it\\ncertain that true orgasm was involved.\"  \\n\\n     Putting two and two together-- Kinsey\\'s empiricism and lengthy\\nexperimentation-- she arrives at her hint.  But realizing this dog\\nwould not hunt, she devoted but a single paragraph to Kinsey\\'s\\nsupposed planning before shifting to the issue of his personal\\ninvolvement.  As for the alleged participation, after poring over\\nPomeroy\\'s biography, Reisman found several hidden clues suggesting\\nKinsey\\'s likely hands-on approach to kiddie sex.  Here the chain of\\nreasoning is more complex.  She points out that Kinsey was interested\\nin clitoral measurements, collecting sperm and filming sex in his\\nattic.  Since Kinsey did indeed mislead Indiana University about the\\npurpose of his cinematography-- he said that he was filming \"animal\\nsex\"-- Reisman asserts that a \"similar misrepresentation may yet apply\\nto Kinsey\\'s child sex experiments.\"  Catch the \"may\"!\\n\\n     Reisman was also struck by Kinsey\\'s doubting Thomas attitude\\ntoward the never before recorded climax of female rabbits: \"Kinsey,\\naccording to Pomeroy, was the type of person who needed to see things\\nfor himself.  Pomeroy gave the example of orgasm in the female rabbit.\\nBecause he had not personally witnessed this event, Kinsey had\\ndifficulty in accepting its reality, even on the strength of testimony\\nfrom a distinguished scientist.  How then did Kinsey testify to the\\nactuality of orgasm in a 5-month-old infant from the mere \\'history\\' of\\na sex offender?\" (But, of course, he did not: he depended on their\\nrecords.) \\n\\n     From this fantastic alchemy of conjecture mixed with clitorides,\\nsperm, attic cumshots, and climax-in-cottontail has Reisman defamed\\nthe legendary Kinsey.\\n\\n     Paul Gebhard succeeded Kinsey as the director of the Kinsey\\nInstitute and now lives in retirement outside Bloomington.  Reached by\\ntelephone, Gebhard defended the pedophile connection and denied\\nReisman\\'s nasty imputations.  \"I don\\'t understand the resistance of\\npeople like Reisman to studying the sexuality of children,\" Gebhard\\nsaid more in exasperation than anger.  \"That is where sex begins.  We\\nwere happy to take data wherever we found it.  Even though pedophiles\\ncommit criminal acts, they are usually not violent folks.  They\\nwouldn\\'t be very successful if they were.  One of our best sources was\\na headmaster of a boys\\' school who maintained a kind of alumni club\\nand sometimes went to the weddings of his former students.  As for\\ndirecting experiments, that\\'s absurd.  We never told any of our\\nsubjects what to do.  lt was against our principles.  Almost all of the\\npedophile material was retrospective anyway.  Nor did we ever conduct\\nsex experiments with children ourselves.  That would have been highly\\ninappropriate.\"  \\n\\n     I asked Gebhard if Kinsey had ever seen a child in a sexual\\nsituation.  \"I think a mother once brought in a little girl who humped\\nher teddy bear and Kinsey watched it.\"  \\n\\n     As for Kinsey\\'s sex life, it is still shrouded in\\nconfidentiality.  He was married to the same woman for 35 years and\\nfathered four children.  Apparently, there are no huge sexual\\nrevelations, although rumors of homosexuality have persisted without\\nconfirmation through the years.  Gebhard took his boss\\'s history back\\nin the \\'40s, but he refuses to discuss what he knows.  \"We never\\ndivulge anything about anybody\\'s history, whether dead or alive,\" he\\nsays.  \\n\\n     Reisman said no to an interview for this article on the grounds\\nthat I had once worked for Penthouse-- not to mention the fact that we\\nhave been debating each other in various forums for the past five\\nyears.  In keeping with our contentious history, she took a swipe at me\\nin her book for continuing \"the Kinsey practice of euphemizing\\nincest.\"  My offense was using the biblical variant \"lying with a near\\nrelative\" in a 1977 article on the subject of incest.  As a synonym for\\nintercourse, \"lying with\" appears eight times in Genesis.  \\n\\n     Ed Eichel is a different story.  Though seemingly obsessed by\\nKinsey like his coauthor, he was friendly in long conversations.  He\\ntold me that he began to smell a big baised agenda in sexology when he\\nwas a student in New York University\\'s Human Sexuality program in the\\nearly \\'80s.  \"It was literally a gay studies program for heterosexuals,\"\\nhe says.\\n\\n     Around 1985, Eichel came upon Reisman\\'s critique of Kinsey and\\nthe conspiracy theory started to sink in: the sex establishment was\\nruled by a Kinseyan bisexual bund advocating the overthrow of the\\nheterosexual norm.  No wonder he was having such a rough time promoting\\nthe joy of simultaneous orgasm-- anything that enhanced sexual\\ncompatibility between men and women inevitably raised objections.\\n\\n     Eventually, Eichel exchanged philosophical fluids with Reisman,\\nand from this union Kinsey, Sex and Fraud was born.  Eichel\\'s main\\ncontribution to the book is discovery and analysis of a Kinsey\\nconspiracy that supposedly seeks \"the establishment of bisexuality as\\nthe balanced sexual orientation for normal, uninhibited people\" which,\\nby destroying the traditional family structure and normal sexual\\nbehavior, \"would open the way for the second and more difficult step--\\nthe ultimate goal of cross-generational sex (sex with children).\"  \\n\\n     When I pressed him for specific references to back up his\\noutrageous contentions, he said weakly, \"You don\\'t think Kinsey is\\ngoing to come right out and say that everybody is basically bisexual\\nand should have sex with kids, but this is implicit in the Kinsey\\nreports.\"  \\n\\n     Meanwhile, Eichel is demanding a congressional investigation of\\nKinsey and his data.  Perfect.  That\\'s just what the country needs-- a\\nHouse Un-American Sexual Activities Committee, looking under beds and\\nasking people if they are now or have everbeen a reader, a sympathizer\\nor-- God forbid-- a subject of Dr. Alfred Kinsey.\\n\\n\\n         Elf !!!\\n--\\nelf@halcyon.com  (Elf Sternberg)',\n",

       " 're: extended Ka bands.\\n\\nI recently bought a 2 band detector.  You guys must all think I\\'m\\nnuts, right?  Well, I did a little research into Ka usage in this\\narea and found out that Ka is not currently being used in this state\\nas well as surrounding states.  Here\\'s how I found out:\\n\\n- A cop friend who did spend time nailing speeders doesn\\'t even know \\n  what Ka is.  He\\'s heard of K, which is what they use here and I\\n  explained that Ka is used for photo radar etc.. He then said, yeah,\\n  \"Ka stands for K automatic\"... duuhh.  He then went on to say that\\n  plans were being made for getting laser guns as far as going high\\n  tech were concerned, but he didn\\'t know too much.\\n\\n- My 8 year old 2 band whistler was consistently going off at speed traps,\\n  even the real sneaky ones.\\n\\n- When I called the Escort Shop, they confirmed that Ka is not used here\\n  or in surrounding states.  They did claim that Laser was being used\\n  a lot here, which I was quite skeptical of.\\n\\nSo in the end, instead of spending a lot of money and/or waiting\\nmonths for a state of the art detector, I got a low priced, high\\nperformance 2 band Escort 2200.

Is the United States considering \\ntaking unilateral action such as air strikes against Serb artillery \\nsites?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first let me say, as you know, for \\nmore than a week now we have been seriously reviewing our options for \\nfurther action.  And I want to say, too, let\\'s look at the last three \\nmonths.  Since I became President I have worked with our allies and \\nwe have tried to move forward, first on the no-fly zone, on \\nenforcement of it, on the humanitarian airdrops, on the war crimes \\ninvestigation, on getting the Bosnian Muslims involved in the peace \\nprocess.  We have made some progress.  And now we have a very much \\ntougher sanctions resolution.  And Leon Fuerth, who is the National \\nSecurity Advisor to the Vice President, is in Europe now working on \\nimplementing that.  That is going to make a big difference to Serbia.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     And we are reviewing other options.  I think we should \\nact.  We should lead -- the United States should lead.  We have led \\nfor the last three months.  We have moved the coalition.  And to be \\nfair, our allies in Europe have been willing to do their part.  And \\nthey have troops on the ground there.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     But I do not think we should act alone, unilaterally, \\nnor do I think we will have to.  And in the next several days I think \\nwe will finalize the extensive review which has been going on and \\nwhich has taken a lot of my time, as well as the time of the \\nadministration, as it should have, over the last 10 days or so.  I \\nthink we\\'ll finish that in the near future and then we\\'ll have a \\npolicy and we\\'ll announce it and everybody can evaluate it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Can I follow up?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Sure.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Do you see any parallel between the ethnic \\ncleansing in Bosnia and the Holocaust?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I think the Holocaust is on a whole \\ndifferent level.  I think it is without precedent or peer in human \\nhistory.  On the other hand, ethnic cleansing is the kind of \\ninhumanity that the Holocaust took to the nth degree.  The idea of \\nmoving people around and abusing them and often killing them solely \\nbecause of their ethnicity is an abhorrent thing.  And it is \\nespecially troublesome in that area where people of different ethnic \\ngroups live side by side for so long together.  And I think you have \\nto stand up against it.  I think it\\'s wrong.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     We were talking today about all of the other troubles in \\nthat region.  I was happy to see the violence between the Croats and \\nthe Muslims in Bosnia subside this morning, and I think we\\'re making \\nprogress on that front.  But what\\'s going on with the Serbians and \\nthe ethnic cleansing is qualitatively different than the other \\nconflicts, both within the former Yugoslavia and in other parts of \\nthe region.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, by any count, you have not had a \\ngood week in your presidency.  The tragedy in Waco, the defeat of \\nyour stimulus bill, the standoff in Bosnia.  What did you do wrong \\nand what are you going to do differently?  How do you look at things?  \\nAre you reassessing?  (Laughter.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I don\\'t really believe that the \\nsituation in Bosnia -- it\\'s not been a good week for the world, but I \\ndon\\'t know that the administration could have made it different.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     On the stimulus package, I\\'d like to put it into the \\nlarger context and remind you that in this 100 days we have already \\nfundamentally changed the direction of an American government.  We \\nhave abandoned trickle-down economics.  We\\'ve abandoned the policies \\nthat brought the debt of this country from $1 trillion to $4 trillion \\nin only a decade.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     The budget plan, which passed the Congress, which will \\nreduce the deficit and increase investment, has led to a 20-year low \\nin mortgage rates, dramatically lower interest rates.  There are \\nprobably people in this room who have refinanced their home mortgages \\nin the last three months, or who have had access to cheaper credit.  \\nThat\\'s going to put tens of billion dollars coursing throughout this \\neconomy in ways that are very, very good for the country.  And so we \\nare moving in the right direction economically.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I regret that the stimulus did not pass, and I have \\nbegun to ask -- and will continue to ask not only people in the \\nadministration, but people in the Congress whether there is something \\nI could have done differently to pass that.  Part of the reason it \\ndidn\\'t pass was politics; part of it was a difference in ideas.  \\nThere are really people still who believe that it\\'s not needed.  I \\njust disagree with that.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I think the recovery -- the economists say it\\'s been \\nunderway for about two years, and we\\'ve still had 16 months of seven-\\npercent unemployment, and all the wealthy countries are having \\ntrouble creating jobs.  So I think there was an idea base -- an \\nargument there, that while we\\'re waiting for the lower interest rates \\nand the deficit reduction and the investments of the next four years \\nto take effect, this sort of supplemental appropriation should go \\nforward.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Now, I have to tell you, I did misgauge that because a \\nmajority of the Republican senators now sitting in the Senate voted \\nfor a similar stimulus when Ronald Reagan was President in 1983, and \\nvoted 28 times for regular supplemental appropriations like this.  I \\njust misgauged it.  And I hope that I can learn something.  I\\'ve just \\nbeen here 90 days.  And, you know, I was a Governor working with a \\ncontentious legislature for 12 years, and it took me a decade to get \\npolitical reform there.  So it takes time  to change things.  But I \\nbasically feel very good about what\\'s happened in the first 100 days \\nwith regard to the Congress.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Waco --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, with regard to Waco I don\\'t have \\nmuch to add to what I\\'ve already said.  I think it is a -- I want the \\nsituation looked into.  I want us to bring in people who have any \\ninsights to bear on that.  I think it\\'s very important that the whole \\nthing be thoroughly gone over.  But I still maintain what I said from \\nthe beginning, that the offender there was David Koresh.  And I do \\nnot think the United States government is responsible for the fact \\nthat a bunch of fanatics decided to kill themselves.  And I\\'m sorry \\nthat they killed their children.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, to follow up partly on Helen on your \\nstimulus package and on your political approach to Capitol Hill, Ross \\nPerot said today that you\\'re playing games with the American people \\nin your tax policy.  He was strongly critical of your stimulus \\npackage.  He said he\\'s going to launch an advertising campaign \\nagainst the North American Free Trade Agreement.  How are you going \\nto handle his political criticism?  Will it complicate your efforts \\non the Hill with your economic plan?  And do you plan to repackage \\nsome of the things that have been in your stimulus program and try to \\nresubmit them to the Hill?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Let me answer that question first.  \\nWe\\'re going to revisit all of that over the next few days.  I\\'m going \\nto be talking to members of Congress and to others to see what we can \\ndo about that.  With regard to the economic plan, I must say I found \\nthat rather amazing.  I don\\'t want to get into an argument with Mr. \\nPerot.  I\\'ll be interested to hear what his specifics are, but I \\nwould -- go back and read his book and his plan.  There\\'s a \\nremarkable convergence except that we have more specific budget cuts, \\nwe raise taxes less on the middle class and more on the wealthy.  \\nBut, otherwise, the plans are remarkably similar.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     So I think it would be -- I\\'ll be interested to see if \\nmaybe perhaps he\\'s changed his position from his book last year and \\nhe has some new ideas to bring to bear.  I\\'ll be glad to hear them.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  To follow up, sir, how do you plan to handle his \\npolitical criticism?  He\\'s launched a campaign against you.  Do you \\nthink you can sit back and just --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first of all, I will ask you to \\napply the same level of scrutiny to him as you do to me.  And if he\\'s \\nchanged his position from the positions he took in the campaign last \\nyear, then we need to know why and what his ideas are.  Maybe he\\'s \\ngot some constructive ideas.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I think the American people have shown that they\\'re very \\nimpatient with people who don\\'t want to produce results.  And the one \\nthing I think that everybody has figured out about me in the last -- \\neven if they don\\'t agree with what I do -- is that I want to get \\nsomething done.  I just came here to try to change things.  I want to \\ndo things.  And I want to do things that help people\\'s lives.  So my \\njudgment is that if he makes a suggestion that is good, that is \\nconstructive, that takes us beyond some idea I\\'ve proposed that will \\nchange people\\'s lives for the better, fine.  But I think that that \\nought to be the test that we apply to everyone who weighs into this \\ndebate and not just to the President.\\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, to go back to Bosnia for a minute.  \\nYou continue to insist that this has to be multilateral action, a \\ncriteria that seems to have hamstrung us when it comes to many \\noptions thus far and makes it look as if this is a state of \\nparalysis.  The United States is the last remaining superpower.  Why \\nis it not appropriate in this situation for the United States to act \\nunilaterally?\\n\\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, the United States -- surely you \\nwould agree, that the United States, even as the last remaining \\nsuperpower, has to act consistent with international law under some \\nmandate of the United Nations.\\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  But you have a mandate and --\\n\\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  They do, and that is one of the things \\nthat we have under review.  I haven\\'t ruled out any option for \\naction.  I would remind all of you, I have not ruled out any option, \\nexcept that we have not discussed and we are not considering the \\nintroduction of American forces into continuing hostilities there.  \\nWe are not.  \\n\\n\\t     So we are reviewing other options.  But I also would \\nremind you that, to be fair, our allies have had -- the French, the \\nBritish and the Canadians -- have had troops on the ground there.  \\nThey have been justifiably worried about those.  But they have \\nsupported the airdrops, the toughening of the sanctions.  They \\nwelcomed the American delegation now in Europe, working on how to \\nmake these sanctions really work and really bite against Serbia.  And \\nI can tell you that the other nations involved are also genuinely \\nreassessing their position, and I would not rule out the fact that we \\ncan reach an agreement for a concerted action that goes beyond where \\nwe have been.  I don\\'t have any criticism of the British, the French \\nand others about that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Would that be military action?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, several of the leading lights in \\nyour administration, ranging from your FBI Director to your U.N. \\nAmbassador, to your Deputy Budget Director to your Health Services \\nSecretary, have issued statements in the last couple of weeks which \\nare absolutely contradictory to some of the positions you\\'ve taken in \\nyour administration.  Why is that?  Are you losing your political \\ngrip?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Give me an example. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Example?  Judge Sessions said that there was no \\nchild abuse in Waco.  Madeleine Albright has said in this morning\\'s \\nnewspapers, at least, that she favors air strikes in Bosnia.  All of \\nthese are things you said that you didn\\'t support.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  First of all, I don\\'t know what -- we \\nknow that David Koresh had sex with children.  I think that is \\nundisputed, is it not?  Is it not?  Does anybody dispute that?  Where \\nI come from that qualifies as child abuse.  And we know that he had \\npeople teaching these kids how to kill themselves.  I think that \\nqualifies as abuse.  And I\\'m not criticizing Judge Sessions because I \\ndon\\'t know exactly what he said.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     In terms of Madeleine Albright, Madeleine Albright has \\nmade no public statement at all about air strikes.  There is a press \\nreport that she wrote me a confidential letter in which she expressed \\nher -- or memo -- in which she expressed her views about the new \\ndirection we should take in response to my request to all the senior \\nmembers of my administration to let me know what they thought we \\nought to do next.  And I have heard from her and from others about \\nwhat they think we ought to do next.  And I\\'m not going to discuss \\nthe recommendations they made to me, but in the next few days when I \\nmake a decision about what to do, then I will announce what I\\'m going \\nto do.  So I wouldn\\'t say that either one of those examples qualifies \\nspeaking out of school.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  How about the Value Added Tax, Mr. President?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  What was that?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  The Value Added Tax -- Mrs. Rivlin and Miss Shalala \\nboth said that they thought that that was a good idea.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I don\\'t mind them saying they think it\\'s \\na good idea.  There are all kinds of arguments for it on policy \\ngrounds.  That does not mean that we have decided to incorporate it \\nin the health care debate.  No decision has been made on that.  And I \\nhave no objection to their expressing their views on that.  We\\'ve had \\na lot of people from business and labor come to us saying that they \\nthought that tax would help make their particular industries more \\ncompetitive in the global economy.  I took no -- that wasn\\'t taking a \\nline against an administration policy.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, a week ago a group of gay and \\nlesbian representatives came out of a meeting with you and expressed \\nin the most ringing terms, their confidence in your understanding of \\nthem and their political aspirations, and their belief that you would \\nfulfill those aspirations.  Do you feel now that you will be able to \\nmeet their now enhanced expectations?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I don\\'t know about that.  And I \\ndon\\'t know what their -- it depends on what the expectations are.  \\nBut I\\'ll tell you this:  I believe that this country\\'s policies \\nshould be heavily biased in favor of nondiscrimination.  I believe \\nwhen you tell people they can\\'t do certain things in this country \\nthat other people can do, there ought to be an overwhelming and \\ncompelling reason for it.  I believe we need the services of all of \\nour people, and I have said that consistently.  And not as a \\npolitical proposition.  The first time this issue came up was in 1991 \\nwhen I was in Boston.  I was just asked the question about it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     And I might add -- it\\'s interesting that I have been \\nattacked -- obviously, those who disagree with me here are primarily \\ncoming from the political right in America.  When I was Governor, I \\nwas attacked from the other direction for sticking up for the rights \\nof religious fundamentalists to run their child care centers and to \\npractice home schooling under appropriate safeguards.  I just have \\nalways had an almost libertarian view that we should try to protect \\nthe rights of American individual citizens to live up to the fullest \\nof their capacities, and I\\'m going to stick right with that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Are you concerned, sir, that you may have generated \\nexpectations on their end and criticism among others that has \\nhamstrung your administration in the sense of far too great emphasis \\non this issue?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Yes, but I have not placed a great deal \\nof emphasis on it.  It\\'s gotten a lot of emphasis in other quarters \\nand in the press.  I\\'ve just simply taken my position and tried to \\nsee it through.  And that\\'s what I do.  It doesn\\'t take a lot of my \\ntime as President to say what I believe in and what I intend to do, \\nand that\\'s what I\\'ll continue to do.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, getting back to the situation in \\nBosnia -- and we understand you haven\\'t made any final decisions on \\nnew options previously considered unacceptable.  But the two most \\ncommonly heard options would be lifting the arms embargo to enable \\nthe Bosnian Muslims to defend themselves and to initiate some limited \\nair strikes, perhaps, to cut off supply lines.  Without telling us \\nyour decision -- presumably, you haven\\'t made any final decisions on \\nthose two options -- what are the pros and cons that are going \\nthrough your mind right now and will weigh heavily on your final \\ndecision?  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I\\'m reluctant to get into this.  There \\nare -- those are two of the options.  There are some other options \\nthat have been considered.  All have pluses and minuses; all have \\nsupporters and opponents within the administration and in the \\nCongress, where, I would remind you, heavy consultations will be \\nrequired to embark on any new policy.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I do believe that on the air strike issue, the \\npronouncements that General Powell has made generally about military \\naction, apply there.  If you take action, if the United States takes \\naction, we must have a clearly-defined objective that can be met.  We \\nmust be able to understand it and its limitations must be clear.  The \\nUnited States is not, should not, become involved as a partisan in a \\nwar.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     With regard to the lifting of the arms embargo, the \\nquestion obviously there is if you widen the capacity of people to \\nfight will that help to get a settlement and bring about peace?  Will \\nit lead to more bloodshed?  What kind of reaction can others have \\nthat would undermine the effectiveness of the policy?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     But I think both of them deserve some serious \\nconsideration, along with some other options we have.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Do you think that these people who are trying to \\nget us into war in Bosnia are really remembering that we haven\\'t \\ntaken care of hundreds of thousands of veterans from the last war and \\nwe couldn\\'t take care of our prisoners and get them all home from \\nVietnam?   And now many of them are coming up with bills for \\ntreatment of Agent Orange.  How can we afford to go to any more of \\nthese wars?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think that\\'s a good argument \\nagainst the United States itself becoming involved as a belligerent \\nin a war there.  But we are, after all, the world\\'s only super power.  \\nWe do have to lead the world  and there is a very serious problem of \\nsystematic ethnic cleansing in the former Yugoslavia, which could \\nhave not only enormous further humanitarian consequences -- and \\ngoodness knows there have been many -- but also could have other \\npractical consequences in other nearby regions where the same sorts \\nof ethnic tensions exist.\\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  Did you make any kind of agreement with Boris \\nYeltsin to hold off either on air strikes or any kind of aggressive \\naction against the Serbs until after Sunday?  And in general, how has \\nhis political situation affected your deliberation on Bosnia?\\n\\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  No, I have not made any agreement, and \\nhe did not ask for that.  We never even discussed that, interestingly \\nenough.  The Russians, I would remind you, in the middle of President \\nYeltsin\\'s campaign, abstained from our attempt to get tougher \\nsanctions through the United Nations in what I thought was the proper \\ndecision for them and one that the United States and, I\\'m sure, the \\nrest of the free world very much appreciated. \\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  Do you wish, Mr. President, that you\\'d become more \\ninvolved in the planning of the Waco operation?  And how would you \\nhandle that situation differently now?\\n\\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I don\\'t think as a practical matter that \\nthe President should become involved in the planning of those kinds \\nof things at that detail.  One of the things that I\\'m sure will come \\nout when we look into this is -- the questions will be asked and \\nanswered, did all of us who up the line of command ask the questions \\nwe should have asked and get the answers we should have gotten?  And \\nI look forward to that.  But at the time, I have to say, as I did \\nbefore, the first thing I did after the ATF agents were killed, once \\nwe knew that the FBI was going to go in, was to ask that the military \\nbe consulted because of the quasi, as least, military nature of the \\nconflict given the resources that Koresh had in his compound and \\ntheir obvious willingness to use them.  And then on the day before \\nthe action, I asked the questions of the Attorney General which I \\nhave reported to you previously, and which at the time I thought were \\nsufficient.  I have -- as I said, I\\'m sure -- I leave it to others to \\nmake the suggestions about whether there are other questions I should \\nhave asked.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, what is your assessment of Director \\nSessions\\' role in the Waco affair?  And have you made a decision on \\nhis future?  And if you haven\\'t, will you give him a personal hearing \\nbefore you do decide?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first of all, I have no assessment \\nof his role since I had no direct contact with him.  And I mean no \\nnegative or positive inference.  I have no assessment there.  I stand \\nby what I said before about my general high regard for the FBI.  And \\nI\\'m waiting for a recommendation from the Attorney General about what \\nto do with the direction of the FBI.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, since you said that one side in \\nBosnia conflict represents inhumanity that the Holocaust carried to \\nthe nth degree, why do you then tell us that the United States cannot \\ntake a partisan view in this war?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I said that the principle of \\nethnic cleansing is something we ought to stand up against.  That \\ndoes not mean that the United States or the United Nations can enter \\na war, in effect, to redraw the lines, geographical lines of \\nrepublics within what was Yugoslavia, or that that would ultimately \\nbe successful.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I think what the United States has to do is to try to \\nfigure out whether there is some way consistent with forcing the \\npeople to resolve their own difficulties we can stand up to and stop \\nethnic cleansing.  And that is obviously the difficulty we are \\nwrestling with.  This is clearly the most difficult foreign policy \\nproblem we face, and that all of our allies face.  And if it were \\neasy, I suppose it would have been solved before.  We have tried to \\ndo more in the last 90 days than was previously done.  It has clearly \\nnot been enough to stop the Serbian aggression, and  we are now \\nlooking at what else we can do.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Yesterday you specifically criticized the Roosevelt \\nadministration for not having bombed the railroads to the \\nconcentration camps and things that were near military targets.  \\nAren\\'t there steps like that that would not involve conflict --direct \\nconflict or partisan belligerence that you might consider?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  There may be.  I would remind you that \\nthe circumstances were somewhat different.  We were then at war with \\nGermany at the time and that\\'s what made that whole incident so --\\nseries of incidents -- so perplexing.  But we have -- as I say, we\\'ve \\ngot all of our options under review.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  The diplomatic initiative on Haiti is on the verge \\nof collapse.  What can you do to salvage it short of a full-scale \\nmilitary operation?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, you may know something I don\\'t.  \\nThat\\'s not what our people tell me.  I think Mr. Caputo and \\nAmbassador Pezzullo have done together a good job.  The thing keeps \\ngoing back and forth because of the people who are involved with the \\nde facto government there.  It\\'s obvious what their concerns are.  \\nThey were the same concerns that led to the ouster of Aristide in the \\nfirst place, and President Aristide, we feel, should be restored to \\npower.  We\\'re working toward that.  I get a report on that -- we \\ndiscuss it at least three times a week, and I\\'m convinced that we\\'re \\ngoing to prevail there and be successful.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I do believe that there\\'s every reason to think that \\nthere will have to be some sort of multilateral presence to try to \\nguarantee the security and the freedom from violence of people on \\nboth sides of the ledger while we try to establish the conditions of \\nongoing civilized society.  But I believe we\\'re going to prevail \\nthere.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, would you care to make your \\nassessment of the first 100 days before we make one for you?  \\n(Laughter.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I\\'ll say if -- I believe, first of \\nall, we passed the budget resolution in record time.  That was the \\nbiggest issue.  That confirmed the direction of the administration \\nand confirmed the commitments of the campaign that we could both \\nbring the deficit down and increase investment, and that we could do \\nit by specific spending cuts and by raising taxes, almost all of \\nwhich come from the highest income people in this society --reversing \\na 12-year trend in which most of the tax burdens were borne by the \\nmiddle class, whose incomes were going down when their taxes were \\ngoing up, while the deficit went from $1 trillion to $4 trillion, the \\ntotal national debt, and the deficit continued to go up.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     We have a 20-year low in interest rates from mortgages. \\nWe have lower interest rates across the board.  We have tens of \\nbillions of dollars flooding back into this economy as people \\nrefinance their debt.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     We have established a new environmental policy, which is \\ndramatically different.  The Secretary of Education has worked with \\nme and with others and with the governors to establish a new approach \\nin education that focuses on tough standards, as well as increasing \\nopportunity.  We have done an enormous amount of work on political \\nreform, on campaign finance and lobbying reform.  And I have imposed \\ntough ethics requirements on my own administration\\'s officials.  \\nThese things are consistent with not only what I said I\\'d do in the \\ncampaign, but with turning the country around.  The Vice President is \\nheading a task force which will literally change the way the federal \\ngovernment operates and make it much more responsive to the citizens \\nof this country.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     We are working on a whole range of other things.  The \\nwelfare reform initiative, to move people from welfare to work.  And, \\nof course, a massive amount of work has been done on the health care \\nissue, which is a huge economic and personal security problem for \\nmillions of Americans.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     So I think it is amazing how much has been done.  More \\nwill be done.  We also passed the Family Leave bill.  A version of \\nthe motor voter bill -- that has not come out of conference back to \\nme yet.  And everything has been passed except the stimulus program.  \\nSo I think we\\'re doing fine and we\\'re moving in the right direction.  \\nI feel good about it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Sir, a follow-up.  Wouldn\\'t you say, though, that \\none of your biggest initiatives, aid to Soviet Russia, is now \\npractically finished -- if we can\\'t pass a stimulus bill in our own \\ncountry, how can we do it for them?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Let me recast the question a little bit.  \\nIt\\'s a good question -- (laughter) -- it\\'s a good question, but to be \\nfair we\\'ve got to recast it.  We have already -- the first round of \\naid to the Soviet -- to non-Soviet Russia, to a democratic Russia, is \\nplainly going to go through, the first $1.6 billion.  The aid that we \\nagreed with our partners in the G-7 to provide through the \\ninternational financial institutions, which is a big dollar item, is \\nplainly going to go through.  The question is, can we get any more \\naid for Russia that requires a new appropriation by the United States \\nCongress?  And that is a question I think, Mary, that will be \\nresolved in the weeks ahead, in part by what happens to the American \\nworkers and their jobs and their future.  I think the two things will \\nbe tied by many members of Congress.\\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  The tailhook report came out this morning, \\ndocumenting horrendous and nearly-criminal conduct on the part of the \\nNavy.  How much did you discuss the incident and what might be done \\nabout it with your nominee to be the Secretary of the Navy?\\n\\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  First, let me comment a little on that.  \\nThe Inspector General\\'s report details conduct which is wrong and \\nwhich has no place in the armed services.  And I expect the report to \\nbe acted on in the appropriate way.  I also want to say to the \\nAmerican people and to all of you that the report should be taken for \\nwhat it is, a very disturbing list of allegations which will have to \\nbe thoroughly examined.  It should not be taken as a general \\nindictment of the United States Navy or of all the fine people who \\nserve there.  It is very specific in its allegations, and it will be \\npursued.  \\n\\n\\t     The only thing I said to the Secretary-Designate of the \\nNavy and the only thing I should have said to him, I think, is that I \\nexpected him to take the report and to do his duty.  And I believe he \\nwill do that.\\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, to back to Russia for just a minute.  \\nThe latest poll show that Mr. Yeltsin will probably win his vote of \\nconfidence.  But there seems to be a real toss-up on whether or not \\nvoters are going to endorse his economic reforms.  \\n\\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I understand that.  \\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  Can you live with a split -- (laughter) -- can you \\nlive with a split decision, though, or do you need both passed in \\norder to then build support for Russian aid?\\n\\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I believe -- the answer to your question \\nis, for the United States, the key question should be that which is \\nposed to any democracy, which is who wins the election.  If he wins \\nthe election, if he is ratified by the Russian people to continue as \\ntheir President, then I think we should do our best to work with him \\ntoward reform.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     You know, we had a lot of other countries here for the \\nHolocaust Museum dedication -- their leaders were here.  Leaders from \\nEastern Europe, leaders from at least one republic of the former \\nSoviet Union; all of them having terrible economic challenges as they \\nconvert from a communist command and control economy to a market \\neconomy in a world where there\\'s economic slowdown everywhere.  And \\nin a world in which there\\'s economic slowdown and difficulty, all \\nleaders will have trouble having their policies be popular in a poll \\nbecause they haven\\'t produced the results that the people so \\nearnestly yearn for.  You can understand that.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     But if they have confidence in the leadership, I think \\nthat\\'s all we can ask.  And the United States will -- if the Russian \\npeople ratify him as their President and stick with him then the \\nUnited States will continue to work with him.  I think he is a \\ngenuine democrat -- small d -- and genuinely committed to reform.  I \\nthink that we should support that.\\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, Mr. Perot has come out strongly in \\nwhat is perceived behind the line against a free trade agreement --\\nNAFTA.  How hard are you going to fight for this free trade agreement \\nand when do you expect to see it accomplished?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I think we\\'ll have the agreement ready \\nin the fairly near future.  You know, our people are still working \\nwith the Mexican government and with the Canadians on the side \\nagreements.  We\\'re trying to work out what the environmental \\nagreement will say, what the labor agreement will say, and then what \\nthe fairest way to deal with enforcement is.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     The Mexicans say, and there is some merit to their \\nposition, that they\\'re worried about transferring their sovereignty \\nin enforcement to a multilateral commission.  Even in the United \\nStates, to be fair, we have some folks who are worried about that --\\nabout giving that up.  On the other hand, if we\\'re going to have an \\nenvironmental agreement and a labor standards agreement that means \\nsomething, then there has to be ultimately some consequences for \\nviolating them.  So what we\\'re trying to do is to agree on an \\napproach which would say that if there is a pattern of violations --\\nif you keep on violating it past a certain point -- maybe not an \\nisolated incident, but a pattern of violation -- there is going to be \\nsome enforcement.  There must be consequences.  And we\\'re working out \\nthe details of that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     But I still feel quite good about it.  And this is just \\nan area where I disagree with Mr. Perot and with others.  I think \\nthat we will win big if we have a fair agreement that integrates more \\nclosely the Mexican economy and the American economy and leads us \\nfrom there to Chile to other market economies in Latin America, and \\ngives us a bigger world in which to trade.  I think that\\'s the only \\nway a rich country can grow richer.  If you look at what Japan and \\nother countries in the Pacific are doing to reach out in their own \\nregion, it\\'s a pretty good lesson to us that we had better worry \\nabout how to build those bridges in our own area.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     So this is an idea battle.  You know, you\\'ve got a lot \\nof questions and I want to answer them all, but let me say not every \\none of these things can be distilled simply into politics -- you \\nknow, who\\'s for this and who\\'s for that, and if this person is for \\nthis, somebody else has got to be for that.  A lot of these things \\nhonestly involved real debates over ideas, over who\\'s right and wrong \\nabout the world toward which we\\'re moving.  And the answers are not \\nself-evident.  And one of the reasons that I wanted to run for \\nPresident is I wanted to sort of open the floodgates for debating \\nthese ideas so that we could try to change in the appropriate way.  \\nSo I just have a difference of opinion.  I believe that the concept \\nof NAFTA is sound, even though, as you know, I thought that the \\ndetails needed to be improved.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, there was a tremendous flurry of \\ninterest earlier this month in the Russian document that purported to \\nshow that the Vietnamese had held back American prisoners.  General \\nVessey has now said publicly that while the document itself was \\nauthentic, he believes that it was incorrect.  Do you have a personal \\nview at this point about that issue?  And more broadly, do you \\nbelieve that, in fact, the Vietnamese did return all the American \\nprisoners at the time of the Paris Peace Accord?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  First let me say, I saw General Vessey \\nbefore he went to Vietnam and after he returned.  And I have a high \\nregard for him and I appreciate his willingness to serve his country \\nin this way.  As to whether the document had any basis in fact, let \\nme say that the government of Vietnam was more forthcoming than it \\nhad been in the past and gave us some documents that would tend to \\nundermine the validity of the Russian documents claim.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I do not know whether that is right or wrong.  We are \\nhaving it basically evaluated at this time, and when we complete the \\nevaluation, we\\'ll tell you.  And, of course, we want to tell the \\nfamilies of those who were missing in action or who were POWs.  I \\nthink that we\\'ll be able to make some progress in eliminating some of \\nthe questions about the outstanding cases as a result of this last \\ninterchange, but I cannot say that I\\'m fully satisfied that we know \\nall that we need to know.  There are still some cases that we don\\'t \\nknow the answer to.  But I do believe we\\'re making some progress.  I \\nwas encouraged by the last trip.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  I\\'d like to follow up on that.  Before the U.S. \\nnormalizes relations, allows trade to go forward, do you have to be \\npersonally sure that every case has been resolved or would you be \\nwilling to go forward on the basis that while it may take years to \\nresolve these cases, the Vietnamese have made sufficient offerings to \\nus to confirm good faith?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  A lot of experts say you can never \\nresolve every case, every one, that we couldn\\'t resolve all the cases \\nfor them and that there are still some cases that have not been \\nfactually resolved, going back to the Second World War.  But what I \\nwould have to be convinced of is that we had gone a long way toward \\nresolving every case that could be resolved at this moment in time, \\nand that there was a complete, open and unrestricted commitment to \\ncontinue to do everything that could be done always to keep resolving \\nthose cases.  And we\\'re not there yet.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Again, I have to be guided a little bit by people who \\nknow a lot about this.  And I confess to being much more heavily \\ninfluenced by the families of the people whose lives were lost there, \\nor whose lives remain in question than by the commercial interest and \\nthe other things which seem so compelling in this moment.  I just am \\nvery influenced by how the families feel.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     your economic stimulus package, are you doing \\nsome kind of reality check now and scaling back some of your plans, \\nyour legislative plans for the coming year, including the crime bill, \\nthe health care initiative and other things?  Are there any plans to \\ndo that?  And also, did you underestimate the power of Senator Bob \\nDole?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  No, what I underestimated was the extent \\nto which what I thought was a fairly self-evident case, particularly \\nafter we stayed below the spending caps approved by this Congress, \\nincluding the Republicans who were in this Congress last year -- when \\nwe had already passed a budget resolution which called for over $500 \\nbillion in deficit reduction.  When they had voted repeatedly for \\nsupplemental appropriations to help foreign governments, I thought at \\nleast four of them would vote to break cloture, and I underestimated \\nthat.  I did not have an adequate strategy of dealing with that.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I also thought that if I made a good-faith effort to \\nnegotiate and to compromise, that it would not be rebuffed.  Instead, \\nevery time I offered something they reduced the offer that they had \\npreviously been talking to the Majority Leader about.  So it was a \\nstrange set of events.  But I think what happened was what was a \\nsignificant part of our plan, but not the major part of it, acquired \\na political connotation that got out of proportion to the merits, so \\nthat a lot of Republicans were saying to me privately, \"Mr. \\nPresident, I\\'d like to be for this, but I can\\'t now.  And we\\'re all \\nstrung out and we\\'re divided.\"  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     And I think we need to do a reality check.  As I said, \\nwhat I want to know -- let me go back to what I said -- what I want \\nto know from our folks and from our friends in the Senate on -- and \\nRepublicans or Democrats -- is what could I have done differently to \\nmake it come out differently.  Because the real losers here were not \\nthe President and the administration.  The real losers were the \\nhundreds of thousands of people who won\\'t have jobs now.  We could \\nhave put another 700,000 kids to work this summer.  I mean, we could \\nhave done a lot of good things with that money.  And I think that is \\nvery, very sad.  And it became more political than it should have.  \\nBut the underlying rationale I don\\'t think holds a lot of water --\\nthat it was deficit spending.  That just won\\'t wash.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     and redo --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  No.  I mean, you know, for example --you \\nmentioned the crime bill.  I think it would be a real mistake not to \\npass the crime bill.  I mean, the crime bill was almost on the point \\nof passage last year.  And they were all fighting over the Brady \\nBill.  Surely, surely after what we have been through in this country \\njust in the last three months, with the kind of mindless violence we \\nhave seen, we can pass a bill requiring people to go through a \\nwaiting period before they buy a handgun.  And surely we can see that \\nwe need more police officers on the street.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     That\\'s another thing that -- I really believe that once \\nwe move some of that money -- not all, but some of it up into this \\njobs package to make some of the jobs rehiring police officers on the \\nstreet who\\'d been laid off, that would be a compelling case.  I mean \\npeople are scared in this country and I think we need to go forward. \\nI feel very strongly that we need to go forward on the crime bill.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, back to the tailhook report for a \\nsecond.  That report contained very strong criticism of the Navy\\'s \\nsenior leadership in general, but did not name any of the senior \\nofficers.  Do you believe that the senior officers who are implicated \\nin this, including Admiral Kelso who was there one night in Las \\nVegas, should they be disciplined and do you believe the public has a \\nright to know the names of the senior officers?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  You should know that under the rules of \\nlaw which apply to this, I am in the chain of command.  There is now \\nan Inspector General\\'s report and the law must take its course.  If I \\nwere to answer that question I might prejudice any decisions which \\nmight be later made in this case.  I don\\'t really think -- I think \\nall I can tell you is what I have already said.  I was very disturbed \\nby the specific allegations in the Inspector General\\'s report, and I \\nwant appropriate action to be taken.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Until the proper procedures have a chance to kick in and \\nappropriate action is taken, I have been advised that because I am \\nthe Commander-in-Chief I have to be very careful about what I say so \\nas not to prejudice the rights of anybody against whom any action \\nmight proceed or to prejudice the case in any other way either pro or \\ncon.  So I can\\'t say any more except to say that I want this thing \\nhandled in an appropriate and thorough way.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, could I ask you for a clarification \\non Bosnia?  You said that you were not considering introduction of \\nAmerican forces.  Does that include any air forces as well as ground \\nforces, sir?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I said ground forces.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  You said ground forces.  Could I ask you, sir, if \\nyou fear that using U.S. air strikes might  draw the United States \\ninto a ground war there?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I just don\\'t want to discuss our \\nevaluation of the options anymore.  I\\'ve told you that there\\'s never \\nbeen a serious discussion in this country about the introduction of \\nground forces into an ongoing conflict there.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  With hundreds of thousands of gays in Washington \\nthis weekend for the march, did you ever reconsider your decision to \\nleave town for this weekend?  Did you ever consider in any way \\nparticipating in some of the activities? \\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  No.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Why not?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Because I -- and, basically, I wouldn\\'t \\nparticipate in other marches.  I think once you become President, on \\nbalance, except under unusual circumstances, that is not what should \\nbe done.  But more importantly, I\\'m going to the American Society of \\nNewspaper Editors, a trip that presumably most of you would want me \\nto make, to try to focus anew on what I think are the fundamental \\nissues at stake for our country right now.  And I expect that I will \\nsay something about the fact that a lot of Americans have come here, \\nasking for a climate that is free of discrimination; asking, \\nbasically, to be able to work hard and live by the rules and be \\ntreated like other American citizens if they do that, and just that.  \\nAnd that\\'s always been my position -- not only for the gays who will \\nbe here, but for others as well.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Thank you very much.',\n",

They KNEW that Koresh considered the\\ntanks to be the Chariots of Fire mentioned in the Book of Revelations.\\nThey KNEW that sending tanks, oops, combat engineering vehicles,\\nobstensibly to perform \"gas insertions\" (love that NewSpeak) WOULD push\\nhim over the edge.\\n\\nLook at some supporting evidence.  Koresh\\'s attorney mentioned on TV\\nearlier today (4/20) that one of Koresh\\'s major concern was the biblical\\nrole of the tanks stationed around the compound.  The FBI (through Reno\\non Larry King last night and at the news conference this morning)\\nclaimed to have listening devices in the compound.  If that was true\\nthey KNEW their actions were driving him to the brink.  They KNEW they\\nwere pushing the Davidians toward mass suicide.  Any rational and\\nreasonable agency NOT interested in killing those people would, at\\nthe first sign of preparations for suicide, have pulled completely back and\\nwould have gotten rid of all the armor.  Instead they continued with the\\n\"gas insertion\" right up to the point where flames appeared.  The image\\nthat will remain etched in my mind is that of the tank strutting back\\nand forth in front of the burning compound, gloating over the kill.\\n\\nLet\\'s step back and assess how this thing could have been ended without\\nbloodshed.  This technique would have required a law enforcement agency\\ninterested in constitutionally enforcing the law and in the preservation\\nof life instead of achieving a military victory and of vengence.\\n\\nThe way to have nabbed Koresh was simply to have announced a pull back,\\nabandoned the assault, torn down the concertina wire and removed the\\narmor, maintained covert surveillance of the compound and then exploited\\nhis ego to flush him out.  Exploiting his ego would have been simple.  A\\nsimple invite or two from the tabloid talk shows to come on TV and tell\\nhow he whipped the US government would have been something he could not\\nhave resisted.  He could have then been nabbed when he left the\\ncompound.  Simple, clean and safe but because it would have required the\\nFBI to execute a tactical retreat and would have deprived them of the\\nrevenge they sought, it was totally out of the question.  Not without\\nall that testesterone floating around.  After all Jannet Reno had to\\nshow the world how big her balls are.\\n\\nYesterday was a sad, sad day for the American system.

       " 'It\\'s been a while since I\\'ve reviewed a car but today I paid a visit\\nto an old friend whose love for Audis has been so overwhelming that he\\nmakes a not too sucessful living selling them.\\n\\nWithout further delay, I will get to the 1993 Audi S4:\\n\\n\\n1) Servotronic steering:\\n\\n[For those who are not familiar with what Servotronic is, it is the\\nname for the speed variable power steering manufactured by ZF and\\nused in Audis and BMWs.]\\n\\nI have been outspoken in my damming of Servotronic over the past\\ncouple of months, and this was based on magazine reviews and drives of\\nthe Audi 90 CS quattro and the Audi 100CS fwd.  I am quite happy to\\nreport now that on the S4, the Servotronic is *inoffensive*.  I\\nsuppose that due to the fat gumball tires, the Servotronic has been\\nloaded up more and this, so far has been the best implementation that\\nI have tried.  It is far from perfect, mind you, and I\\'d be much\\nhappier if it was an option that I could refuse, but on the S4, I no\\nlonger consider this to be bad enough where I feel the entire car is\\nruined.\\n\\nThe steering is still a tad too light, but it is accurate and I\\nsuppose the stiffly sprung chassis sends back so much information that\\nsome makes it through to the driver\\'s hands.  So there is feel and\\nthere is accuracy in the S4\\'s steering.  But there is also room for\\nimprovement.  I consider the S4\\'s steering to be better than the\\nJapanese competition, primarily because the Japanese do not believe in\\n\"feel\" and engineer it out completely.\\n\\n\\n2) Engine\\n\\nWheee! What a pressure cooker.  With just 110 miles on the clock I did\\nnot expect the S4 to be producing anywhere close to what it will be\\nputting out 10000 miles later, but still, the car packs a terrific\\npunch.  For a turbocharged machine, it is very unusual in that it\\nencourages lazy driving.  i.e. low revs, high gear.  It is so\\nsupremely flexible that one could hardly believe that there\\'s only 2.2\\nliters of displacement to move this 3700 pound car around in such a\\nfashion.  With maximum torque available at 1950 rpm and a 7200 rpm\\nredline, the car can pretty much be left in third all day.. which\\ntranslates to a speed range of something like 20-100 mph.  A\\nchracteristic that one normally associates with large capacity V8s.\\nThe technical achievement is breadthtaking.\\n\\nThrottle response is right up there with a good atmospheric engine. In\\nfact, it would even put peaky multivalve engines to shame. Downshifts\\nare almost unnecessary.  It is more fun to use the \"overboost\" feature\\nthan to rev the engine.  For those not familiar, the S4 engine features\\nup to 15 seconds of additional turbo boost for passing.  Sort of like\\nlighting up the after burners in a jet fighter, one could, with the\\nright foot only, in third gear, blast the car from 30 to 80 in just a\\nfew moments.. simply by flooring the gas.  As far as the numbers go,\\nmaximum torque available in overboost mode shoots up to about 270 lb\\nft.. incredible for a 2.2 liter.  It takes a few moments for it to\\ndevelop overboost but it is well worth waiting for.  Since this is quite\\na heavy car, one\\'s body parts are not flung around like say, the Corrado\\nVR6.  The acceleration is smooth and strong, somewhat similar to riding\\nin a jetliner as it accelerates down the runway on takeoff.  Also, one\\nis treated to a very distinctive and entertaining whistle from the\\nturbo.. the only entertaining sound to come out of a very\\nrefined but bland sounding 5 banger..\\n\\nYes, Audi has refined the 5 to the point where at 7200 rpm it sounds as\\nserene as it does at 2000.  The smoothness is outstanding, but not quite\\nup to the standards of a very good 6, e.g. a 12 valve BMW.  I\\'d say that\\nin terms of refinement, i.e. willingness to rev, smoothness, lack of\\nharshness under full acceleration it is better than many V6s.  However,\\nlost in the refinement process is the characteristic 5 cylinder bark\\nthat made the older engines so characterful, if not terribly refined.\\nThe 20 valve turbo 5 sounds pretty bland except for the whistle under\\nfull boost.  Subjectively, I\\'d rate the VW VR6 engine as being far more\\nmusical than the turbo 5.. Also, Audi\\'s own V8 is also far more musical,\\nwith a rorty race car growl when pressed,  though none of these can\\nmatch its grunt.\\n\\nThe only hint of the engine\\'s true capacity occurs when one is taking\\noff from rest after the turbo has come to a near stop.  With the extra\\ninertia from the permanently engaged 4wd system, one has to be somewhat\\ndelicate in feeding in the clutch to prevent an embarassing stall. \\nAlternately one could use more revs.. In both cases a very small price\\nto pay for such a fantastic engine.  I think that Audi of America should\\noffer an automatic option for this car, just as they offer (though in\\nextremely small numbers) a 5 speed for the much peakier V8.  The\\ncharacteristics of the engine are perfect for an automatic.  Ironically,\\nin europe a slush is available but none is offered for the land of the\\nslush.  Marketing twits rearing their ugly heads again...\\n\\n\\n3) Chassis\\n\\nI\\'ve noticed that Audis tend to have very wide wheels and relatively\\nmodest tire widths.  The car comes with Firestones of size 225/50 ZR16..\\nwhich is not uncommon at all.  However, the very attractive 5 spoke\\nwheels are no less than 8 inches wide, so there is no sidewall bulge\\nwhatsoever.  Combined with the flared wheel arches, the S4 has a mouth\\nwatering macho, yet subdued look. \\n\\nOn rough concrete, it becomes immediately clear that the new 100 body\\nstyle has made significant advances in structural rigidity as well as\\nroad noise suppression.. I suppose the two are inter-related, but I\\ndigress.  To use a cliche, the S4\\'s body feels like it has been carved\\nout of stone.  Flex is totally undetectable, even when going over rough\\nroads.  With a super rigid body like this stiff springs and stiff dampers\\ndo not cause excessive harshness and while the S4\\'s ride quality will\\nnever worry a Lexus, it will also not draw comparisons to trucks or\\npony cars.\\n\\nThe servotronic steering has already been mentioned.  I consider it to\\nbe inoffensive because it did not inhibit spirited cornering.  I  was\\nable to test the car\\'s cornering powers without too much trepidation. I\\nthink a new concept is at work in this car.  With its fat gumball tires,\\ntalking about understeer or oversteer is practically meaningless.  On a\\nbanked highway on ramp, I went in slow and started applying power as I\\nwent around.  I could feel the g forces build to the point where the\\nskin on my face was being tugged sideways.  Yet the car was totally and\\ncompletely obedient to throttle and steering inputs.. It felt that the\\nlimits were not even close to being approached.  The g forces were\\nthrilling, but the entire affair of going around a curve is strangely\\nuninvolving.  You tell the car what you want and it does it.  End of\\nstory.  I think that I am starting to relate more and more to those\\nreviewers who were highly impressed by the Honda NSX\\'s clinical\\nefficiency but were unable to fall in love with the car.\\n\\nThe brakes have a very good firmness to them and stop the car pretty\\nwell too, though I\\'ve read that they are prone to fade.  I am not too\\nsurprised, since the S4 does not have uprated brakes over the base Audi\\n100 fwd. Harder pads would help, but that in turn would lead to a more\\nwooden response when cold.  I am starting to see a trend among the\\nluxury/sports sedan makers where extra weight is not being offset by\\nadditional braking capacity.  The LS400\\'s fade performance is nothing to\\nbrag about; neither is the Q45\\'s or the Legend\\'s.  Brake fade these days\\nseem to be a forgotten virtue when everybody\\'s attention is focused on\\nanti-lock capability.\\n\\n\\n4) Comfort\\n\\nFor a car with such sporty abilities, its comfort levels are also\\nexcellent.  The cabin is beautifully appointed, with carbon-fiber panel\\ninserts in place of the wood trim of the \\'92 S4.  All the expected\\ngizmos are there.. heated seats, power seats, seat memory, power this\\nand that.  The glaring ommision was the trip computer, which was removed\\nbecause Audi hasn\\'t gotten it to work reliably yet.. That means that the\\ncar has no boost gauge.  A real disappointment taking into account how\\nmuch the turbo dominates its performance.  \\n\\nUnusual for the germans, the S4 comes with a Honda style moonroof, as\\nwell as the very intelligent dial-a-sunroof-position rotary switch.\\n\\nNoise levels, including engine and tire noise is so low that I wouldn\\'t\\nconsider the Lexus\\' advantage in this area to be significant enough\\nto sway a potential buyer.\\n\\n\\n5) Conclusion\\n\\nEven though few will be able to afford an Audi S4 at its sticker price\\nof $48K, the car is a bargain if one takes into account what it has to\\noffer over the competition.  The 20 valve turbo 5 is a real gem, even if\\nit doesn\\'t produce Ferrari sounds.  No other luxury/sports sedan maker\\noffers the utter security of quattro all wheel drive, which to some is\\nworth the extra money all by itself.  The safety features are also \\ntop notch.. 1994 side impact standard compliant, the very elegant \\nautomatic seat belt tensioners and the dual airbags.  The 100 series\\nAudis have been outstanding in government crash tests.  It gets my\\nthumbs up for being so overwhelmingly capable rather than being\\nall out exciting and intoxicating.\\n',\n",

The most recent\\nresearch  is  that  of Dr. Gary Kleck of the  Florida  State\\nUniversity  School of Criminology.1  He found that  handguns\\nare  more  often  used by victims to defeat  crime  than  by\\ncriminals to commit it (645,000 vs. 580,000 respectively  in\\nthis  study).  These figures are even more encouraging  when\\nyou  consider the number of crimes that never occur  because\\nof  the  presence  of a gun in the hands  of  a  law-abiding\\nprivate  citizen.  In a National Institute of Justice  study\\nof  ten state prisons across the country they found that 39%\\nof  the  felons  surveyed had aborted  at  least  one  crime\\nbecause  they believed that the intended victim was  armed.,\\nand  57% agreed that \"most criminals are more worried  about\\nmeeting an armed victim than they are about running into the\\npolice.\"2\\n     One  of the most heinous of crimes is that against  the\\nwomen  of  this country.  It has been my recent  observation\\nthat  more  women  are purchasing handguns  for  defense  in\\nresponse  to  the  present danger of these  assaults.   This\\nshould be taken as encouraging news if the events of Orlando\\nFlorida  are any indicator.  In the late 1960\\'s  the  female\\npopulace was plagued with a series of brutal assaults;  just\\nthe  publicity of the record number of women buying guns and\\nobtaining training resulted in an 88% decrease in  rape  for\\nthat  area,  the  only city of its size in  the  country  to\\nexperience a decrease of crime for that year.  Additionally,\\na 1979 US Justice Department study of 32,000 attempted rapes\\nshowed  that overall, when rape is attempted, the completion\\nrate  is 36%. But when a woman defends herself with  a  gun,\\nthe completion rate drops to 3%.\\n \\n1 G Kleck, Point Blank: Guns and Violence in America Aldine\\nde Gruyter, NY, 1991\\n2 JD Wright & PH Rossi Armed and Considered Dangerous:  A\\nSurvey of Felons and Their Firearms, Aldine de Gruyter, NY,\\n1986\\n-------\\n\\n__________________________________________________________________________\\n[unlike cats] dogs NEVER scratch you when you wash them.

PDT\\n\\n\\t     \\t  \\n\\t     Q\\t  I had two questions for both Presidents, so you \\ncould probably answer for Boris, too.  (Laughter.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I'll give you my answer, then I'll \\ngive you Yeltsin's answer.  (Laughter.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  The first is that this is the meeting of the \\nPresidents, so the money that's being promised is government \\nmoney, and naturally it's going to be distributed through the \\ngovernment.  But you've indicated that three-quarters are going \\nto be going to businesses.  So the question is how the Russian \\nbusinesses themselves are going to be consulted, if ever?  What \\nare the priorities, because there are several association of \\nRussian businessmen existing already, so will they be invited to \\nparticipate in setting up priorities for investment?  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     This is the first.  And second, to you.  We know \\nthat polls, public polls in America do not show that Americans \\nare very enthusiastic about giving this aid.  Like Newsweek polls \\nsay that about 75 percent don't approve it, and New York Times \\npublished that 52 percent support if it just prevents civil war; \\n42 percent if it fosters democratic reform; and only 29 percent \\nif it just personally supports Yeltsin.  How are you going to \\nsort of handle this problem that Americans themselves are not \\nvery enthusiastic?  Thank you.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  I have a question, I'm sorry -- is there going \\nto be a translation of everything into Russian?  No, just the \\nanswers.  Just the answers.  Okay.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  The answer to the first question is, \\nit depends on what kind of aid we're discussing.  For example, \\nthe funds that will be set up for financing new businesses will \\nobviously go to those businesses who apply and who seem to be \\ngood risks and make the application.  The privatization fund will \\nbe used to support the privatization of existing public \\nenterprises.  Then there are some other general funds in the \\nDemocracy Corps and other things which people in Russia will have \\nsome influence over the distribution of.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     With regard to your second question, let me say that \\nI would think that there would be people in both countries who \\nwould not feel too warmly toward simply the American government \\ngiving money to the Russian government.  There's opposition to \\nthat in Russia.  And in our country, throughout our whole history \\nthere has been an opposition to foreign aid of all kinds.  That \\nis, this has nothing to do with Russia.  If you look at the whole \\nhistory of America, any kind of aid program has always been \\nunpopular.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     What I have tried to tell the American people is, is \\nthis is not an aid program, this is an investment program; that \\nthis is an investment in our future.  We spent $4 trillion --\\ntrillion -- on armaments on soldiers and other investments \\nbecause of the Cold War.  Now, with a democratic government in \\nRussia, with the newly independent states, the remainder of them \\nworking on a democracy and struggling to get their economies \\ngoing, it seems to me very much in our interest to make it \\npossible to do whatever we can for democracy to survive, for the \\neconomy of Russia to grow because of the potential for trade and \\ninvestment there, and for us to continue the effort to reduce \\nnuclear weapons and other elements of hostility on both sides, on \\nour side and on the Russian side.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     So I don't see this as an aid program; this is an \\ninvestment for the United States.  This is very much in the \\ninterest of the United States.  The things I announced today, the \\nsecond stage of the program, which I hope to put together next \\nweek, in my view are things that are good for my country and for \\nthe taxpayers and workers of my country.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Russia is a very great nation that needs some \\npartnership now, some common endeavor with other people who share \\nher goals.  But it would be a great mistake for anyone to view \\nthis as some sort of just a charity or an aid issue.  That's not \\nwhat it is, it's an investment for America and it's a wonderful \\ninvestment.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Like all investments, there is some risk.  But \\nthere's far less risk with a far greater potential of return than \\nthe $4 trillion we spent looking at each other across the barrier \\nof the Cold War.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. President, first of all thank you very \\nmuch, indeed, for coming here and talking to us.  In the memory \\nof the living correspondents, this is the first time an American \\nPresident is doing this to the Russian press corps, so it's kind \\nof a very measured breakthrough.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I have two questions.  One, in your introductory \\nremarks of the other press conference, you mentioned in brief \\nthat you discussed the START II and START I issues.  Could you \\ntell us:  Did you reach an agreement with President Yeltsin as to \\nwhat might be done in order to have Ukraine join the ratification \\nof START I and the NPT regime?  And my second question is, how \\nconfident you are that the United States Congress would be eager \\nto support you in lifting Jackson-Vanik and other restrictions \\ninherited from the Cold War?  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     PRESIDENT CLINTON:  First, we discussed the issue of \\nUkraine with regard to START I and NPT, and generally, with \\nregard to the need to proceed to have the other independent \\nstates all be non-nuclear; but also to have the United States \\ndevelop strong relationships with them.  We know that one thing \\nthat we could do that would increase, I think, the willingness of \\nthe Ukraine to support this direction is to successfully conclude \\nour own negotiations on highly enriched uranium, because that \\nwould provide not only an important economic opportunity for \\nRussia, but also for Ukraine, and it would show some reaching out \\non our part.  But we agreed that basically the people who signed \\noff on the Lisbon Protocol have got to honor what they did, and \\nwe agreed to continue to press that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I, myself, have spent a good deal of time trying to \\nreassure Ukraine's leaders, specifically the President and the \\nForeign Minister, that I want strong ties with Ukraine, that the \\nUnited States very much wants a good relationship with Ukraine, \\nbut that, in order to do what we need to do together to \\nstrengthen the economy of Ukraine and to have the United States \\nbe fully supportive, the commitment to ratify START I and to join \\nthe NPT regime is critical.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     What was the second question?  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  With regard to Jackson-Vanik and \\nCOCOM, I would make two points:  First, I have agreed with the \\nRepublican and Democratic leaders in the Congress that we will, \\nas soon as I return, have a list of all the legislative and other \\nrestrictions, some of them are regulatory in nature, imposed on \\nrelations between the United States and Russia, that are legacies \\nof the Cold War.  And we will see whether they're -- how many of \\nthem we could agree to do away with right now, at least among the \\nleadership of the Congress.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     With regard to Jackson-Vanik, I think there will be \\nan openness to change the law if the Congress is convinced there \\nare, in fact, no more refusniks, no more people who wish to \\nemigrate who are not being allowed to.  If the fact is that there \\nis no one there who would have been -- who the law was designed \\nto affect, then I think that the desire to keep the law will be \\nmuch less.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     With regard to COCOM, my guess is, and it's nothing \\nmore than a guess, that the leadership of Congress and indeed my \\nown advisers, might prefer to see some sort of phased movement \\nout of the COCOM regime.  But I think they would be willing to \\nbegin it in the fairly near future.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Mr. Clinton, when I read your speech in \\nAnnapolis, I got the impression that you have a completely \\ndifferent personal -- and I stress that -- personal, not \\npolitical approach towards Russia, compared to the approach of \\nMr. Bush.  Could you formulate in a few words, what is the \\ndifference between you as a personality and your approach -- the \\ndifference between your approach to Russia and the approach of \\nMr. Bush?  And who made you -- why did you cite Akhmatova in the \\nlast part of your speech?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Let me say, first, I do not wish to \\ncompare myself with President Bush or anyone else.  I can't say \\nwhat was in his heart about Russia.  I can say that since I was a \\nboy, I have been personally fascinated with the history, the \\nmusic and the culture, and the literature of Russia.  I have been \\nthrilled by Russian music since I was a serious student of music \\nfor more than 30 years now.  I have read major Russian novelists \\nand many of your poets and followed your ballet and tried to know \\nas much as I could about your history.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     And I went to the Soviet Union -- but it was then \\nthe Soviet Union -- you may know it was a big issue in the last \\npresidential campaign that I spent the first week of 1970 alone \\nin Moscow and did not return again until three days before Mr. \\nYeltsin was elected President.  But all that time I was away, I \\nwas following events there very closely and hoping for the day \\nwhen we could be genuine partners.  So I have always had a \\npersonal feeling about Russia.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I remember, for example -- a lot of you know I like \\nmusic very much.  One of the most moving experiences for me as a \\nmusician was when Leonard Bernstein took the New York \\nPhilharmonic to Moscow and played Shostakovich's Fifth Symphony \\nto the Russians.  And he played the last movement more rapidly \\nthan anyone had ever played it before because it was technically \\nso difficult.  That is something I followed very closely when it \\noccurred.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     These are things that have always had a big impact \\non my life.  And I had just always hoped that someday, if I ever \\nhad the chance to, I could play a role in seeing our two \\ncountries become closer partners.

They, however, have indirectly created\\n   the impression that Iran is behind the rise of fundamentalist\\n   Islamic movements and thus are indirectly implicated in this matter.\\n\\n2) Public statements by the Secretary of State Christoffer and\\n   other official sources regarding Iran being a terrorist and\\n   outlaw state.\\n\\n3) And finally the recent broadcast of the Frontline program. I \\n   suspect that this PR campaign against Iran will continue and\\n   perhaps intensify.\\n\\nWhy this increased pressure on Iran? A number of factors may have\\nbeen behind this. These include:\\n\\n1) The rise of Islamic movements in North-Africa and radical\\n   Hamas movement in the Israeli occupied territories. This\\n   movement is basically anti-western and is not necessarily\\n   fueled by Iran. The cause for accelerated pace of this \\n   movement is probably the Gulf War which sought to return\\n   colonial Shieks and Amirs to their throne in the name of\\n   democracy and freedom. Also, the obvious support of Algerian\\n   military coup against the democratically elected Algerian\\n   Islamic Front which clearly exposed the democracy myth.\\n   A further cause of this may be the daily broadcast of the news\\n   on the slaughter of Bosnian Moslems.\\n\\n2) Possible future implications of this movement in Saudi Arabia\\n   and other US client states and endangerment of the cheap oil\\n   sources from this region.\\n\\n3) A need to create an enemy as an excuse for huge defense\\n   expenditures. This has become necessary after the demise of\\n   Soveit Union.\\n\\nThe recent PR campaign against Iran, however, seems to be directed\\nfrom Israel rather than Washington. There is no fundamental conflict\\nof interest between Iran and the US and in my opinion, it is in the\\ninterest of both countries to affect reestablishment of normal\\nand friendly relations.

       " 'First, I would like to say how much I appreciate having so literate and\\nerudite an individual as Mr. Rutledge with whom to discuss this topic.\\nFrankly, most anti-RKBA posters refuse even to approach the topic of\\nthe original understanding of the Bill of Rights as detailed in the\\nwritings of the era. This  is most refreshing.\\n\\nSecond, I must apologize for leaving the discussion for several days.\\nMy brigade\\'s quarterly drill was this weekend and I needed to attend\\nto several matters pertaining to the State Militia.\\n\\nSome people seem to feel that the concept of the Militia is an anachro-\\nnism that is out of place in the 20th century. I\\'m not sure the Swiss\\nwould agree and I think perhaps a discussion of how the Militia, both\\norganized and unorganized, fits into the defense plans of my State,\\nMississippi. Please do not assume that this describes something peculiar\\nto one southern state. For instance, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts\\nhas a well organized Militia which, members report, maintains stocks\\nof both riot guns and machine guns. The laws of other States will vary\\nbut are probably similar.\\n\\nTitle 35  of Mississippi Code defines our Militia as \"all able-bodied\\ncitizens of the state between the ages of seventeen (17) and sixty-\\ntwo (62) years...\". The Militia is divided into 3 classes: The National\\nGuard, the Mississippi State Guard and the unorganized Militia.  The\\nNational Guard is a strange sort of fish from a Constitutional perspective.\\nIt tries to be both State Militia and Federal Reserve. The discussion\\nof this \"para-constitutional\" arrangement is quite interesting in itself\\nbut somewhat beyond the scope of this discussion. Suffice it that, at this\\ndate, the National Guard has ceased to have any Constitutional standing\\nas anything but a Federal reserve force.\\n\\nMississippi, and most other States, maintains a purely State organized\\nMilitia. In Mississippi this is called The State Guard. In other \\nStates it may be called something else. The State Guard exists as\\na cadre or training corps made up of mostly experienced officers and\\nsenior NCOs who serve as volunteers without compensation. We drill\\non a monthly basis at the company and battalion level, brigade once\\na quarter and have an annual drill of the whole organization. Our\\nState-authorized cadre strength is 694. This is a skeleton of an\\norganization without any flesh. The muscle and sinew when needed will\\ncome from the unorganized Militia.\\n\\nIn time of invasion, insurrection or calamity the Governor can order\\nthe activation of the State Guard. When this takes place a call will\\nfirst be made  for volunteers to fill the organization out to either\\nits contingency strength of 2194 or full strength of 4910. In the\\nevent that a sufficient number of people fail to volunteer, the law\\nprovides detailed instructions for the conducting of a draft of the\\nunorganized Militia. The size of the State Guard is not specified by\\nlaw, but rather by executive order. At one time, the organized Militia\\nof Mississippi consisted of 68 regiments. Needless to say, the State\\ndoes not have armories brimming with weapons with which to equip such\\na force. The historical precedent for arming such a force is by use\\nof mostly the private arms of the Militiamen. \\n\\nIt is my hope that demonstrates that State Militias are far from being\\nthe long dead anachronisms that some may wish to claim.\\n\\n\\nRegarding Hamilton: If you take Hamilton\\'s opinion as being the sole\\nrepresentative of the opinions of the Founding Fathers, you will have\\nchosen a highly skewed sample set. Hamilton was on the extreme Federalist\\nend of the political spectrum. Others, such as Coxe and Henry, can\\nbe chosen to represent the other end. Many contemporaries felt that\\nthe idea of having a standing Army of any sort or even a select Militia\\nor \"train bands\" were contrary to the egalitarian nature of the govern-\\nment they were striving to perfect. The compromise reached was to\\nprovide for a small Army, which had to be refinanced every two years,\\nand iron-clad protection for the Militia, which was to remain ever,\\n\"terrible and irresistible\".\\n\\nThese protections included: State control, not Federal; limitation\\nof Federal utilization of the Militia (i.e. execute Laws, suppress\\nInsurrections and repel Invasions), and the Right to Keep and Bear\\nArms to prevent what the British had tried to do at Lexington.\\nThese limitations eventually proved so onerous to the Federal Govern-\\nment that they were skirted by the creation of the National Guard.\\n\\nThe National Guard was created for one very simple reason: the \\nConstitutional Militia was had proved too unreliable for fighting\\nwars of imperial expansion. (e.g. Spanish-American War). The\\nConstitution provided that the Militia could only be employed by\\nthe Federal government in very limited purposes. As far back as the\\nWar of 1812, Militia units had refused to leave United States\\nterritory to attack the enemy. Further, there was no Constitutional\\nauthorization for any conscription of anyone into the Federal\\nMilitary and Militiamen were particularly protected. In all wars until\\nWW-I every American who left the country under arms was a volunteer.\\nWhen the National Guard acts of 1903-1916 required that each new\\nmember also enlist as a reservest in the Army, existing soldiers were\\n\"grandfathered\". At least one of these \"grandfathered\" individuals\\nrefused to go to France in 1918 and his refusal was upheld by the\\nFederal Courts.\\n\\nMr. Rutledge has stated that the Second Amendment applies only to\\nmembers of a \"well organized\" militia. However, the pre-Constitutional\\nhistory of the American Militia shows relatively few periods when\\nThe Militia came close to meeting either Messrs. Rutledge or Hamilton\\'s\\ndefinition of \"well organized\". In the period of peace between the\\nFrench & Indian War and The Revolution many companies simply stopped\\ndrilling and had to be reconstituted just prior to The Revolution.\\nPerhaps Mr. Rutledge would care to argue that those of my ancestors\\nwho answered the Lexington alarm had forfeited their rights because\\ntheir units didn\\'t drill for a few years in the 1760s. I would not\\nbe so bold.\\n\\nAgain, I wish to repeat. The National Guard, for all its merits, is\\nnot the Militia described by the Constitution  nor by Mr. Hamilton\\nnor by Mr. Henry nor by Mr. Coxe. The fact that the Federal Government\\nand many States are delinquent in their attentions to and organizing\\nof their Constitutional Militias  diminishes neither their\\nresponsibilities nor the rights of the Militia as detailed in the\\nConstitution.\\n \\nMisunderstanding of the nature and purpose of the Militia is but one\\nerror that has crept into modern readings of the Constitution. The\\nConstitution prohibits States from keeping \"Troops or Ships of War\\nin time of Peace\". I have heard some insist this prevents States from\\nmaintaining a Militia, but this comes about because people today do not\\nunderstand the meanings of the words in their 18th century usage.\\nToday we call any large vessel a \"ship\" but in the 18th century the word\\ndescribed a particular kind of vessel.  A \"ship\" is a large vessel with\\nthree or more masts each carrying square rigged sails. A \"brig\" has two\\nmasts. In the contemporary usage the States were prohibited only from keeping\\nthe largest warships of the day, those capable of global operations. Today\\'s\\nequivalent might be a prohibition on the States\\' keeping nuclear missiles.\\n\"Troops\" at this time meant a full-time professional military organization.\\nAny study of contemporaneous writings will bear this out. \\n\\nIn at least one respect, I am in agreement with Mr. Rutledge; being\\npersonally involved in the maintenance and advancement of The Militia\\nas a viable means of defense for a modern society, I am frequently\\nboth bemused and saddened when friends and associates wax poetic on\\ntheir place in the unorganized Militia and become strangely silent or\\nscarce when invited to attend a  drill of their State\\'s Militia.',\n",

I wouldn\\'t\\npress Ford to hurry the Mustang since the final wait could be worth it.\\nBesides, no bow-tie fanatic is gonna buy the Mustang anyway.\\n\\nI do not put much stock in the mag rags\\' \"inside\" information, or even\\nFord rep quotes.  The Taurus was pretty much a surprise when it was\\nfinally disclosed in it\\'s entirety.  \"Inside\" information had the\\nTaurus with a V8 and rear-wheel drive at one point.  I wouldn\\'t look\\nfor a simple re-paneled Mustang, folks; you may be cheating yourself\\nif you do.  There\\'s a lot of potential.  Ford hasn\\'t released a new\\ncar without a 4-wheel IS in 7 years.  The Mustang project has been\\nbrewing for at least 4, right?  A 4-wheel IS could happen.  Those\\nmodular V8\\'s are out there, too.  In the interest of CAFE and\\ncompetition, don\\'t rule those out, either.   Your ignorant if you do.\\nAnd there are so many spy shots and artist renderings out there,\\nwho really knows what it\\'ll look like?  The Mach III?  Doubt it.\\nHighly.\\n\\nThe next Mustang will be Ford\\'s highest profile car.  It attracts\\nway more attention than the Camaro/Firebird because it\\'s heritage\\nis more embedded in the general public.  Don\\'t lie to yourself and\\nbelieve Ford will forfeit that.\\n\\nI submit that the Mustang will be a success.  Enough to elicit\\ndefensive remarks from some heavy Camaro fans here.  You know,\\nintelligent, critical spews like, \"The Mustang bites, man!\"  Some of\\nyou are already beginning.  I predict that the Mustang and Camaro\\nwill be comparable performers, as usual.  I predict that the\\ndifferences will be in subjective areas like looks and feel, as usual.\\nThe Camaro is still a huge automobile; the Mustang will retain its\\ncab-rearward styling and short, pony-car wheelbase.  The Camaro still\\nreaches out to the fighter pilot, while the Mustang will appeal to\\nthe driver.  The Camaro will still sell to the muscle car set, while\\nthe Mustang will continue to sell to the college-degreed muscle car set.\\nBoth will be more refined (I do think the Camaro is).  There will be\\nno clear winner.\\n\\nUnless the Ford gets the 32v, 300hp Romeo.

Madness.\" ---------- */\\nFROM THE ISRAELI PRESS.\\n\\nPaper: Zman Tel Aviv (Tel Aviv\\'s time). Friday local Tel Aviv\\'s\\npaper, affiliated with Maariv.\\n\\nDate: 19 February 1993\\n\\nJournalist: Guy Ehrlich\\n\\nSubject: Interview with soldiers who served in the Duvdevan\\n(Cherry) units, which disguise themselves as Arabs and operate\\nwithin the occupied territories.\\n\\nExcerpts from the article:\\n\\n\"A lot has been written about the units who disguise themselves as\\nArabs, things good and bad, some of the falsehoods. But the most\\nimportant problem of those units has been hardly dealt with. It is\\nthat everyone who serves in the Cherry, after a time goes in one\\nway or another insane\".\\n\\nA man who said this, who will here be called Danny (his full name\\nis known to the editors) served in the Cherry. After his discharge\\nfrom the army he works as delivery boy. His pal, who will here be\\ncalled Dudu was also serving in the Cherry, and is now about to\\ndepart for a round-the-world tour. They both look no different\\nfrom average Israeli youngsters freshly discharged from conscript\\nservice. But in their souls, one can notice something completely\\ndifferent....It was not easy for them to come out with disclosures\\nabout what happened to them. And they think that to most of their\\nfellows from the Cherry it woundn\\'t be easy either. Yet after they\\nbegan to talk, it was nearly impossible to make them stop talking.\\nThe following article will contain all the horror stories\\nrecounted with an appalling openness.\\n\\n(...) A short time ago I was in command of a veteran team, in\\nwhich some of the fellows applied for release from the Cherry. We\\ncalled such soldiers H.I. \\'Hit by the Intifada\\'. Under my command\\nwas a soldier who talked to himself non-stop, which is a common\\nphenomenon in the Cherry. I sent him to a psychiatrist. But why I\\nshould talk about others when I myself feel quite insane ? On\\nFridays, when I come home, my parents know I cannot be talked to\\nuntil I go to the beach, surf a little, calm down and return. The\\nkeys of my father\\'s car must be ready for in advance, so that I\\ncan go there. I they dare talk to me before, or whenever I don\\'t\\nwant them to talk to me, I just grab a chair and smash it\\ninstantly. I know it is my nerve:  Smashing chairs all the time\\nand then running away from home, to the car and to the beach. Only\\nthere I become normal.(...)\\n\\n(...) Another friday I was eating a lunch prepared by my mother.\\nIt was an omelette of sorts. She took the risk of sitting next to\\nme and talking to me. I then told my mother about an event which\\nwas still fresh in my mind. I told her how I shot an Arab, and how\\nexactly his wound looked like when I went to inspect it. She began\\nto laugh hysterically. I wanted her to cry, and she dared laugh\\nstraight in my face instead ! So I told her how my pal had made a\\nmincemeat of the two Arabs who were preparing the Molotov\\ncocktails. He shot them down, hitting them beautifully, exactly as\\nthey deserved. One bullet had set a Molotov cocktail on fire, with\\nthe effect that the Arab was burning all over, just beautifully. I\\nwas delighted to see it.  My pal fired three bullets, two at the\\nArab with the Molotov cocktail, and the third at his chum. It hit\\nhim straight in his ass. We both felt that we\\'d pulled off\\nsomething.\\n\\nNext I told my mother how another pal of mine split open the guts\\nin the belly of another Arab and how all of us ran toward that\\nspot to take a look. I reached the spot first. And then that Arab,\\nblood gushing forth from his body, spits at me. I yelled: \\'Shut\\nup\\' and he dared talk back to me in Hebrew! So I just laughed\\nstraight in his face. I am usually laughing when I stare at\\nsomething convulsing right before my eyes. Then I told him: \\'All\\nright, wait a moment\\'. I left him in order to take a look at\\nanother wounded Arab. I asked a soldier if that Arab could be\\nsaved, if the bleeding from his artery could be stopped with the\\nhelp of a stone of something else like that. I keep telling all\\nthis to my mother, with details, and she keeps laughing straight\\ninto my face. This infuriated me. I got very angry, because I felt\\nI was becoming mad. So I stopped eating, seized the plate with he\\nomelette and some trimmings still on, and at once threw it over\\nher head. Only then she stopped laughing. At first she didn\\'t know\\nwhat to say.\\n\\n(...) But I must tell you of a still other madness which falls\\nupon us frequently. I went with a friend to practice shooting on a\\nfield. A gull appeared right in the middle of the field. My friend\\nshot it at once. Then we noticed four deer standing high up on the\\nhill above us. My friend at once aimed at one of them and shot it.\\nWe enjoyed the sight of it falling down the rock. We shot down two\\ndeer more and went to take a look. When we climbed the rocks we\\nsaw a young deer, badly wounded by our bullet, but still trying to\\nsuch some milk from its already dead mother. We carefully\\ninspected two paths, covered by blood and chunks of torn flesh of\\nthe two deer we had hit. We were just delighted by that sight. We\\nhad hit\\'em so good ! Then we decided to kill the young deer too,\\nso as spare it further suffering. I approached, took out my\\nrevolver and shot him in the head several times from a very short\\ndistance. When you shoot straight at the head you actually see the\\nbullets sinking in.  But my fifth bullet made its brains fall\\noutside onto the ground, with the effect of splattering lots of\\nblood straight on us. This made us feel cured of the spurt of our\\nmadness. Standing there soaked with blood, we felt we were like\\nbeasts of prey. We couldn\\'t explain what had happened to us. We\\nwere almost in tears while walking down from that hill, and we\\nfelt the whole day very badly.\\n\\n(...) We always go back to places we carried out assignments in.\\nThis is why we can see them. When you see a guy you disabled, may\\nbe for the rest of his life, you feel you got power. You feel\\nGodlike of sorts.\"\\n\\n(...) Both Danny and Dudu contemplate at least at this moment\\nstudying the acting. Dudu is not willing to work in any\\nsecurity-linked occupation. Danny feels the exact opposite. \\'Why\\nshouldn\\'t I take advantage of the skills I have mastered so well ?\\nWhy shouldn\\'t I earn $3.000 for each chopped head I would deliver\\nwhile being a mercenary in South Africa ? This kind of job suits\\nme perfectly. I have no human emotions any more. If I get a\\nreasonable salary I will have no problem to board a plane to\\nBosnia in order to fight there.\"',\n",
       " \"\\nOK. Lets look into this.\\nAccording to my dictionary,\\nZi-on-ism: an international movement orig. for the establishment of a Jewish\\nnational or religious community in Palestine and later for the support of\\nmodern Israel.\\n\\nNow, I do not support the establishment of nations based on religious \\nprinciples, while I support the establishment of nations based on cultural\\nidentities.\\n\\nSo. Here are some questions I have to ask for anyone to answer. My point\\nis what someone said long time ago: In politics, like with men, it is important\\nto distiguish between what they say they do and what they are actually\\ndoing.\\n\\n1) My mother is Jewish (and so is my father). If I apply for the Law of\\nReturn, do I get in as a Jew trying to return to his land, from which my\\nfamily was expelled about 2000 years ago?\\n2) If I go back, which nationality would my ID show?\\n3) If I decided to go back to the land from which my relatives had been \\nexpelled 2000 years ago, but first I convert to any other religion, can I \\napply to the law of Return as a member of the Jewish Nation or should I \\napply as someone whose mother is Jewish?\\n4) Which nationality would show my ID in case 3)?\\n5) What has change in me between the day before and the day after I converted\\nto loose my being part of the Jewish Nation?\\n6) Suppose I want to get married to my current wife, who is non-Jewish in\\nIsrael, how do I do it?\\n7) How would my situation change if I decided, after going back to\\nIsrael, to convert to Islam?\\n\\n\\nNow, here is one more question. I do believe that most people in a country\\ndo not care about politics. They just want to be left alone.\\nSuppose my father is Arab. Suppose he was born in Palestine, in some place \\nwhich now is part of Israel. Suppose that his father, and his grandfather as\\nwell as 20 or 30 generations before him were born in that place.\\nNow suppose there is a war of independence and my father, scared by all the\\nfighting going on, tries to take his family to a place more secure, among \\npeople he knows, who speak a language he understands, who worship the same\\ngod. Now, suppose that that place is some other Arab country. \\nAnd, now suppose that the war is over and that there is a new country created\\nwhere my father used to live, and that that country is called Israel.\\nAnd, that in that country, Jews from all over the world are received. And\\nthat people whose family left thet country 200 generation ago are recieved and\\ngranted full-citizenship.\\nShould I, if I decided to go back to my father's land, where he was born as\\n20 or 30 generations of my family were born, have the right to go back and\\nask to be recognized in the same way those who are returning after 2000\\nyears?\\n\\nThen, finally, people ask me how I would define a Jew, but that is irrelevant.\\nI am not talking about how I would define a Jew, but about how people in \\nZionist organizations, and more important, in Israel, define a Jew.\\nHow would those who are Zionist define a Jew? \\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

By trying to inject\\nthe notion of race into the discussion, you muddy the waters without\\nadding any insight whatever.  The same parallel question could\\nbe \"Is a polydactyl person a human being?\"  You still have not\\nanswered what you mean by human being.

And as he pointed out,\\nbrain death is not a means of determining who has the rights\\nof the living, but rather who has died.  There is a significant\\ndifference.\\n\\nWhat I am wondering now is, has your argument so failed you that\\nyou feel it necessary to drag out irrelevancies and leave the\\nthread you started?  You got answers to your questions when\\nyou began baiting me, if you recall, after you had made some\\nridiculous remarks about Adrienne Regard and, having been corrected,\\nchanged the subject with your remarks about having a discussion\\nof substance.  If you really wanted a discussion of substance,\\nwhy then do you disregard logic and substance in order to toss\\nsilly accussations, e.g. \"It really doesn\\'t matter to you...\"\\nIf it matters to you, then why not define human being and seek\\nsome substance?  You\\'re not going to convince a logical person\\nof the rightness of your position unless you apply some logic\\nand show some meaning to your words.\\n\\n\\nAs others point out, one is sacrificed for the other depending on\\nwhich has the better chance at survival.  Again, your analogy\\nfails.  Not precedence, but possession makes a difference here.\\nA woman\\'s womb is indisputably her own.  Also, I see you ignore\\nmy statement that you would grant rights to a fetus that would\\nnot be granted a born human being.  Was that due to its inconvenience?\\n\\n\\nIs it?  Please cite a precedent and the basis of the ruling.\\n\\n\\nYou simply assert things without any support.  Your analogy is\\nnot accurate and your assertions are unsupported.  Try this on\\nfor size.  It is not murder for one Siamese twin to kill\\nthe other in the womb.  There.  We now have equal arguments.\\nBut the idea is illogical.  For one Siamese twin to kill the\\nother in the womb would likely be to kill itself as well.  The\\nsystems are dependent on each other for life.  I\\'m still struggling\\nto see anything analagous here and failing to do so.\\n\\n\\nYour argument is from Fantasy Island.  Your comparison is a total\\nfailure, as I have demonstrated already, and has no basis in\\nreality, neither legally nor medically.  And for you to assert\\nthat it is not a perfect comparison because of the impossible,\\nthat of coercion or oppression, is ridiculous.  As I said,\\nyou give the analogy too little credit for failure.  On the one\\nhand you start this by saying you want to take a real, rather than\\na hypothetical, situation, then you fly off into Siamese twins\\nmurdering one another in the womb or coercing or oppressing each\\nother in the womb when the reality of the situation you describe\\nin now way matches your version.  As I said before, decisions\\nare made regarding which twin lives and dies in situations where\\nthey cannot both survive.  And, furthermore, as I have already said,\\nthere is a difference between an equal claim to organs and a claim\\nthat is unequal.  You seem to be asserting that a fetus has a\\nclaim on a woman\\'s womb.  When the fetus is born, what happens to\\nits claim?  And by what reason do you assert its claim?\\n\\n\\nYou haven\\'t answered the question.  The situations are not analagous.\\n\\n\\nAgain you avoid the question.  Dependence can be transferred, and\\nit is not as slow as you seem to think.\\n\\n\\nYes, and I\\'d hate to have been the one to tell Dr Gunn\\'s children that\\nhe was murdered by a religious, \"pro-life\" fanatic.

In the one\\ncase you do not recognize a difference between a fetus and a born\\nchild (you ask why a born child cannot be abandoned but a fetus\\ncan), and in this case you recognize a significant difference\\nbetween the fetus and born child where the lives of the two are at\\nstake.  You can\\'t have it both ways.  Action and inaction are\\nirrelevant to the principle, but you are wrong about the inaction\\nanyway.  Ask any of the numerous women who post here and have\\nborne children how inactive their pregnancy was.  To have a\\nhealthy, live child, a woman does more than hang out, eat as\\nshe chooses, plays volleyball like she always did, drinks at\\nparties with her friends, etc.  She behaves very differently, and\\nthe provision of her resources to a fetus may be no more voluntary\\nthan the beating of her heart, but it is far from inactive.',\n",

I\\'ve written fully on this topic before and will again in the \\nfuture.  When I do, I\\'ll make sure you get copies.  \\n\\nThere are many arguments I might make, from the futility and danger \\nof delegating self-defense to the police (see Don Kates in the Jan. \\n10, 1985 WALL STREET JOURNAL) to the real effect of prohibition, \\nshifting consumers from newly-outlawed handguns or semiautomatic \\nrifles to items like sawed-off shotguns or homemade bombs, but I\\'ll \\nlimit myself here to commenting on the newspaper clipping you sent \\nwith your note.  \\n\\nFirst, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a \\nnatural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and \\nConstitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process \\nnor to arguments grounded in social utility.  \\n\\nSecond, publication of some latter-day \"scientific study\" doesn\\'t \\nalter the fact that the gun prohibitionists I discussed in my \\ninterview -- annoying you so much in the process -- were lying.  \\n\\nThird, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a \\nnatural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and \\nConstitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process \\nnor to arguments grounded in social utility.  \\n\\nFourth, as often happens with these things, the \"study\" doesn\\'t \\nsupport the gun prohibitionists\\' original numerical contentions \\nanyway, but simply adds a new layer of spurious claims to an older \\nbody of lies, omissions, and distortions.  \\n\\nFifth, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a \\nnatural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and \\nConstitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process \\nnor to arguments grounded in social utility.  \\n\\nSixth, the fact that gun prohibitionists have been caught lying on \\ncountless occasions (Carl Bakal, author of NO RIGHT TO KEEP AND \\nBEAR ARMS, even confessed to it publicly) makes the value of this \\npresent \"study\" dubious, to say the least.  \\n\\nSeventh, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is \\na natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, \\nand Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic \\nprocess nor to arguments grounded in social utility.  \\n\\nEighth, given your own lifelong service as a federal bureaucrat \\n(not to mention the cynical sophistication of your fiction), you \\nshould be better aware than most people how \"progress\" -- in \\ndesigning \"studies\" to prove whatever you want -- outstrips our \\nability to collect meaningful data.  A case in point we might agree \\non is the fact that it took another kind of prohibitionist 20 or 30 \\nyears to create \"studies\" \"proving\" that pornography causes crime.  \\nMore naive (and probably more honest) efforts in the 50s and 60s \\nclearly indicate the contrary.  \\n\\nNinth, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a \\nnatural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and \\nConstitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process \\nnor to arguments grounded in social utility.  \\n\\nTenth, another reason to doubt all such \"studies\" is that human \\nbehavior (as the Austrian School of economics demonstrates) is far\\ntoo complex and unpredictable to be meaningfully quantified.  The \\nattempt to do so -- and then create public policy based on the \\nresulting pseudo-information -- is wrecking our civilization.  \\n\\nEleventh, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is \\na natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, \\nand Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic \\nprocess nor to arguments grounded in social utility.  \\n\\nTwelfth, the \"study\" is also worthless because it incorporates \\nfigures for suicide, which is not necessarily a tragedy but \\nbasically another individual right, sometimes with ancillary social \\nbenefits.  If anything, perhaps suicide INTERVENTION should be a \\ncriminal offense.  \\n\\nThirteenth and finally, the National Rifle Association officials \\nquoted in the article, whatever their shortcomings (and they are \\nmany), are correct in this instance:  the \"study\" is meaningless \\nbecause the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a \\nnatural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and \\nConstitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process \\nnor to arguments grounded in social utility.  \\n\\nAnd because of that, Adrian, even if the \"study\" were valid, it \\nwouldn\\'t deter me from a lifelong personal objective of seeing that \\nanyone can own any weapon he or she prefers and carry it however, \\nwhenever, and wherever he or she desires without asking anybody\\'s \\npermission. In this I\\'m ably assisted by gun prohibitionists \\nthemselves, whose yawping invariably moves previously unarmed \\npeople to go out and buy their first gun \"while they still can\".  \\nBefore the \\'68 Gun Control Act, most of the \"shooting fraternity\" \\nviewed handguns (incorrectly, as it turned out) as inaccurate, \\nineffective toys.  There probably weren\\'t six million of them in \\nthe whole country.  Now, thanks to Kennedy, Metzenbaum, the Bradys, \\nand their ilk -- AMERICA\\'S GREATEST SPORTING GOODS SALES TEAM -- we \\nprobably manufacture at least that many every year.\\n\\nThe fascinating datum is that Handgun Control, et al. are perfectly \\naware of this -- so I guess you\\'ll have to ask them yourself what \\ntheir real motives are.  \\n\\nLook:  gun-making isn\\'t an arcane or difficult art (and by the way, \\nit\\'s easier to make a fully automatic weapon than a semiautomatic; \\nthe fact that I can still obtain my own weapon of preference, the \\nself-loading pistol, is the only thing which keeps me from pursuing \\nthis further).  Even if it were difficult, there are already a \\nquarter billion firearms in America, with an estimated \"half life\" \\nof 1000 years -- possibly more for stainless steel.  Guns are gonna \\nbe around a long time, Adrian, whether you like it or not.\\n\\nAs for me, to paraphrase Elmer Keith, regardless of what the law \\nprovides or any court decides, I\\'m always going to be armed.  And I \\nwill always work to see that others are, as well.  The bad news is \\nthat there are thousands more -- perhaps even hundreds of thousands \\n-- where I come from.  We can\\'t be stopped by passing laws, we can \\nonly be forced to arm ourselves and others secretly and -- given \\nboth the practical and alleged differences between full automatics \\nand semiautomatics -- perhaps more efficiently.  \\n\\nSo what\\'s the point?  \\n\\nL.

       " '\\nEvery city and suburban police officer I\\'ve seen around the Twin Cities in the\\nlast two years has carried a semi-auto of some type (different brands though\\nI haven\\'t seen any Glock\\'s). \\n\\nWith regard to this discussion:  We are getting dangerously far from the usual\\nrantings of t.p.g, and close to the realm of r.g, but I\\'d like to put my two\\ncents worth in.  While there\\'s nothing wrong with a revolver (especially a \\nlarge frame S&W in .357 magnum - my favorite) there are valid advantages to\\nsemi-autos.  I suggest reading Massad Ayoob\\'s (I know, some people can\\'t stand\\nhim and think he\\'s full of bull, but I think that in general his material is\\nvery valid and useful) book _The Semi Auto Pistol in Police Work_ (or something \\nlike that).  He defines a number of ways that semi-auto\\'s are different, and that\\n\"different is good\".  The main advantage is not in increased firepower, but in \\nmore accurate followup shots when you go to single action mode.  There is also a\\ncertain \"propriatory nature\" of each gun that takes some familiarity to \\nlearn.  This may have diminished with time as more criminals become familiar\\nwith different models of semi-autos, but it was cited as stopping or at least\\nslowing down criminals who had grabbed a police officers gun.\\n\\n\\nYes, but this is best done with a two hand hold.  With a single hand you either\\npull the gun far off target to cock, or must fire double action.  The DA semi\\nauto has the same advantages plus is always SA after the first shot.\\n\\n\\n\\nI\\'m not sure if this is meant to be different from your first point.  In a DA\\nsemi-auto you can pull the trigger again to try dropping the hammer on the same\\nround - an advantage you don\\'t have in a revolver where the next trigger pull will\\nalways go to the next round (discussing this point now).  This is fine with a dud\\nbut what about a hangfire situation?  Granted it\\'s very rare, but your round will\\nnow go off confined in the cylinder with no place to go.  Slingshotting the slide\\non a misfire takes very little time.\\n\\n\\n\\nActually with modern revolver designs incorporating hammer blocks this is not\\nnecessary or usually recommended.  A revolver would have to fall hard enough and\\nat the right angle to actually break the hammer and driver the firing pin into the\\nround to set it off.\\n\\n\\nThe best speedloader users, especially those using the spring loaded speed\\nloaders are very fast.  A problem is that ejecting the spent cases is a two\\nhanded job where dropping the expended magazine is one handed.  This means that\\nwhile you can be inserting a fresh magazine as soon as the old one clears the\\ngun, with a speed loader you have to go through more motions that will always \\ntake more time.  You also don\\'t have the advantage of tactical reloads (replacing\\na partial magazine to bring you back to full capacity - the partial magazine can\\nstill be used if needed later).  \\n\\n\\nYes, the time to recognize the problem is just as important as the time to clear\\nit.  Really though, in either a revolver or semi-auto the odds of an actual misfire\\nwith factory ammo are awfully small.  You are more likely to get a jam in a semi-auto\\nbut even these are exceptionally rare with modern quality guns (Sigs, Glocks, et.al.).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAll common semi-auto\\'s can be carried with a round in their chamber without any\\nsafety problems.  While I put that out as a statement that I believe, I should\\nsay that this applies to all of the ones I\\'ve looked at.  For the DA semi\\'s it\\'s\\nno different from the revolver situation:  The guns all have hammer or firing\\npin blocks.  They also have a safety.  Because there\\'s no real advantage\\ncarrying one of these cocked and locked you have the same safety and speed\\nof employment as a revolver, plus the advantage of SA followup shots.  I\\'m\\nnot familiar with SA semi-autos except for the 1911-A1.  I admit that I was\\ninitially skeptical about carrying this cocked and locked, but after examining\\nthe design, trying to defeat the safeties (gun unloaded of course), and \\nshooting it a lot, I see no inherent safety problems with it, especially in\\na thumbreak holster with the strap under the hammer.  This design also gets\\nyou more speed for an accurate first shot than a revolver.\\n\\n\\nYeah, the infamous Glock.  I still can\\'t figure out how it\\'s worse than a revolver\\nfor safety.  If you don\\'t pull the trigger it doesn\\'t go off.  I imagine that if all\\nyour revolver shooting was done double action then you could pull the Glock trigger\\nfar enough to fire before you realized it.  In addition, if you had developed that\\nnasty habit of keeping your finger on the trigger when holstering your gun and\\nrelying on your thumb on the hammer to remind you to take it off before you blew\\noff your foot then you\\'d have problems when the hammer wasn\\'t there.\\n\\n\\nI think this is even okay for a riot (as long as it\\'s a small one B^)).\\n\\n\\nI have the poor man\\'s Beretta (Taurus 99) and consider it inferior as a carry\\nweapon to the Springfield .45 (oops, 9mm vs. 45 arguments are relegated to\\nr.g).  You are right, though.  If you don\\'t hit what you aim at then the\\nshooter/gun combination has failed.  I don\\'t ascribe failures in the the\\nfire real fast with a wonder-nine scenario you mention to the gun.  This is\\na shooter failure, whether through lack of discipline or lack of training.\\n\\n\\n\\n9mm\\'s are becoming more popular with crooks too, though the .38 does still\\nlead the list.

However, this does not refute debunking\\nof waiting lines for urgent AND routine care, as has been done in the\\nU.S. by Consumers Reports, health policy studies cited by Prof. Dennis\\nE. Shea on USENET, CNN, NYT, etc.\\n\\nDoug Fierro has posted a NYT article from 3 weeks ago about Canada\\'s\\nhealth insurance approach, on Talk.politics.medicine.  There is one\\nsmall error in the article: not all of our hospitals are private.\\n\\n\\nOf course, the one thing to note is that in the Canada/France/Germany\\ncase, private insurance *offloaded* the basic coverage to the public\\nsector.  They realized they were keeping low-risk/high-profit extra\\ninsurance for things like private/semi-private rooms (vs. ward\\naccomodation), dental, glasses, etc. for corporate or personal\\nbenefits, they\\'ll have nothing to do with you if you want to be\\ncovered for basic care.\\n\\nAt that point, they wouldn\\'t even consider a \"voucher\" approach\\nto broker the universal coverage and sell policies to make up\\nthe difference in the federal guidelines and market stuff.\\n\\n\\nIt is \"free\" in that there are no deductibles nor copayments (two\\nthings which I advocate to make the Canadian insurance look more like\\nreal health insurance -- which actually it is).  I know that when\\nworking in Alberta, Ontario and Quebec, I was aware that I was paying\\nfor health insurance - e.g., in Toronto, OHIP fees were listed on my\\npay stub; Manitoba did not collect at paycheque time, but only\\nannually at income tax time (built into the tax rate).  Only fiscal\\nnaifs will proclaim that it\\'s free, along with the Canadian Left for\\nthat is part of their brainwashing agenda.\\n\\nThe French do have copayments, though.  France Magazine\\'s Summer \\n1992 edition has a fantastic presentation of their basic insurance\\ncoverage, including a sample chart of copayment percentages.  For \\n1-30 days, you\\'re covered for 80% of the public hospital rate, 100%\\nafterward.  With extra private insurance, you can get into a private\\nhospital and be covered for any differences beyond the public hospital\\nrate.  The public insurance covers 100% beyond 30 days, or the same\\ncash amount for a private hospital and the difference is paid\\nout-of-pocket or according to your supplementary private insurance.\\nOver 2/3rds of French have some form of extra private insurance.  So,\\nthe other 30% of health costs in Europe are out of private funds, not\\ngleaned from other taxes.  The GDP figures are combined public and\\nprivate expenditures for total outlay using the same methods that\\nyield the 13-14% figure for the U.S.\\n\\n\\nHealth insurance does exist in Canada and in Western Europe, its\\njust that it doesn\\'t cover basic care.  You can opt out in Canada\\nand Germany, but you\\'ll have to go uninsured as a result because\\nthere are too few other people that do so --- i.e., no market.\\n\\nWhen private insurance realized how much money they\\'d make without the\\nrisks involved in basic insurance (e.g., neurosurgery) versus deluxe\\namenities (e.g., having to call Granada TV to replace a rental set on\\nthe fritz in someone\\'s private hospital room), they started to pat\\nthemselves on the back for their social responsibility.

It doesn't trigger if the car is rocked gently by the wind,\\nbut any kind of shock sets it off.  Even kicking the tire sets it off.  It\\nworks great.\\n\\n\\nThe shock sensor is adjustable and there are two cycles on it.  You can adjust\\nit to be sensitive enough that there is no way you could open the hood without\\nsetting off the alarm.  Although, I know that you cannot pop the hood on the\\nSyclone without setting off my alarm now, and yet I have had zero (none!) false\\nalarms with this system.  The alarm tells you when you disarm it whether it has\\nbeen activated in your absence.  I have been able to trace every alarm to it's\\ncause and it was not a false alarm.\\nI guess it would be possible depending on the vehicle.  My Syclone is so tight\\nin the engine compartment that it would be tough to do this.  There are\\nsupplemental power supplies you can put on with this Viper alarm, but I don't\\nhave one.  I really think that if someone wants my car that bad, the alarm\\nwon't keep them from it, even with a supplemental power supply.\\n\\nThis is primarily for convertibles.  I have a convertible and have looked at\\nthis feature in detail.  Alpine actually makes a better radar unit if you want\\nto get one of these.  It has zones in it that can be shut down independently so\\nthat if one side of your car has pedestrian traffic or something else that\\nwould trigger an alarm, it shuts down the zone, or rather, pulls it in tighter.\\nI don't see the real benefit to these unless you have a convertible that you\\nleave the top down on.\\n\\nAvoid the voice alarm that can be added to the radar package.  It talks to\\npeople as they walk by.  I saw one installed on a Lotus Esprit.  The kids would\\ntaunt it seeing how close they could get before it 'warned' them to get back. \\nThe owner finally disabled it, which defeats the purpose in my mind.\\nI am real happy with my Viper.  One other feature I really like is you can tune\\nit to your preferences.  You can have it arm passively or not.  You can disable\\nthe chirp for arming/disarming.  You can have it lock/unlock the doors when the\\nalarm is armed/disarmed.  \\n\\nI like these features.  I hate the chirp when the alarm arms/disarms, so mine\\nflashes the lights only.  I like the door lock feature, although I have to be\\ncareful to take my keys with me because it doesn't know if you have left your\\nkeys in the car when it passively arms and locks the doors.  But, if you are\\nmeticulous about taking your keys with you, it takes care of the rest.\\n\\nI looked seriously at the Alpine system too.  It is a real nice system, but\\nmore money and it has a motion sensor standard instead of the shock sensor. \\nThe shock sensor is better....and the Viper shock sensor is better (2 cycle)\\nthan the optional Alpine one, IMHO.  I think the Viper gives you a lot of good\\nvalue for the money.  But it isn't absolutely tamperproof.

The 51 day\\nstandoff between federal agents and the Branch Davidians ended on April 19\\nin what appeared to be a mass suicide by fire.  Now that the multi-million\\ndollar standoff is over, a few things remain: cleaning up the mess, and\\nassigning blame.\\n\\n\\\\\\n\\nFrom the onset of the April 19 tear gas attacks by federal agents, President\\nClinton already started passing the buck by saying ``Talk to the attorney\\ngeneral or the FBI... I knew it was going to be done, but the decision was\\n{\\\\it entirely theirs}.  {\\\\it They} made the tactical decision.'' Enter\\nAttorney General Janet Reno.  After most of the Branch Davidians died,\\nReno said she took ``full responsibility'' for the decision.  ``I approved\\nthe plan'' she said adding that she ``did not advise him [Clinton] as to the\\ndetails.''  In fact, she told Clinton that it was ``the best way to go.''\\nAs the fire was roaring through the Branch Davidian's compound Clinton said\\nthat he was ``deeply sadened by the loss of life'' and in the same breath that\\n``the law enforcement agencies involved in the Waco siege recommended the\\ncourse of action pursued today.''  Later he went on to say ``I stand by that\\n[Reno's] decision.''\\n\\n\\\\\\n\\nHow did this all begin?  At 0930 on February 28 agents of the Bureau of\\nAlcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (BATF) launched a full-scale, high-profile\\nassault on the Branch Davidian's compound.  This raid was much\\nmore than an assault on a group suspected of possessing illegal weapons.  The\\nassault was a planned media circus used as a propaganda device of the BATF\\nto show their might and just purpose.\\n\\n\\\\\\n\\nAt the onset of the ``no-knock'' raid, gaggles of heavily armed BATF agents\\nmade their way inside the compound without identifying themselves or state\\nthat they had a warrant until long after the shooting began.\\nSilently, the agents made their way to the compound's buildings and started\\ntheir ``search'' by charging at the buildings and throwing concussion grenades\\nand ordering the cult members to come out of the buildings.\\n\\n\\\\\\n\\nIf unknown persons dressed in black ninja costumes and combat fatigues\\nwere to attack you, throwing grenades and brandishing firearms, would you not\\nassume that these people are criminals and attempt to defend yourself?  The\\ntactics employed by the BATF provoked the battle.\\n\\n\\\\\\n\\nThe initial assualt by the BATF was not successful.  Unfortunately, lives\\nwere lost on both sides.  But, had the assault been a success, the liberal\\nmedia would have praised the BATF by showing the footage of BATF agents\\ncarting away a bunch of gun-wielding religious nuts.  Of course, any\\nviolation of the cult's rights would have been overlooked and the media\\nwould proclaim America's fortune in having super-cop organizations like the\\nBATF that can systematically ``take out'' terroristic groups such as the\\nBranch Davidians.\\n\\n\\\\\\n\\nAs far as I can see, the BATF and the FBI dropped the ball - just like\\nPhiladelphia did in the 1985 MOVE crisis which left 11 dead, 250 homeless,\\nand a city block razed.\\nIt appears that the BATF has adopted the shoot-first tactic of no-knock\\nraids to execute search warrants.  Don't let the BATF convince you that\\nthe no-knock raid was justified.  No-knock assaults make sense when looking\\nfor, say, drugs that can easily be hidden or disposed of in a few seconds.\\nThe BATF was looking for illegal weapons, not drugs that could be hidden or\\nflushed down the toilet in a matter of a few seconds.  What ever happened to\\n``This is the police!  You are surrounded...''?  {\\\\it This policy of no-knock\\nraids, by federal and local agencies, should be restricted}.  Further, the use\\nof military firepower against presumed innocent citizens is a very scary idea,\\nand is why the Davidians were justified in using lethal force to ensure that\\ntheir fourth ammendment rights [``the right of the people to be secure in\\ntheir persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches\\nand seizures''] are not denied.\\n\\n\\\\\\n\\n\\\\\\n\\n\\\\\\n\\n\\\\noindent Matthew L.

It is to those\\nwho read with open mind, that I address myself.\\n\\n%The International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of\\n%Racial Discrimination adopted by the General Assembly of the\\n%United Nations in 1965, has now been ratified by most member\\n%states. Article 1 of this Convention defines the term racial\\n%discrimination as \"any distinction, exclusion, restriction or\\n%preference based on race, colour, descent, or national or ethnic\\n%origin which has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing\\n%the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, of\\n%human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic,\\n%social, cultural or any other field of public life.\"\\n\\nWhile the ideals embodied in this text are worthy goals,\\nas the text currently stands I know of no country in which\\nracial discrimination of some sort can not be found.\\nIt makes no mention of the need for for a legislative\\nviolation.\\n\\n%The General Assembly endorsed in 1975 a resolution defining\\n%Zionism as a form of racism and racial discrimination. The\\n%important, correct and legitimate resolution is incomplete since\\n%it does not include operative statements designed to end Israeli\\n%racial discrimination. Meanwhile the United States, on behalf of\\n%Israel, are exerting heavy pressure on member states of the United\\n%Nations to repeal this resolution and give Israeli racial\\n%practices - Zionism - moral legitimacy.\\n\\nIf you are, in principle, advocating UN intervention via operative\\nstatements in this case, it must therefore hold that they can be\\napplied to any other case where the council perceives some form\\nof racial discrimination as previously exhibited.\\n\\nScarey thought.\\n\\n%The very definition of Israel as a State belonging to the Jews of\\n%the world (but not to its inhabitants), alienates all native\\n%non-Jews born in that country. \\n\\nActually, I know quite a few native non-Jews born in Israel that are not\\nalienated by this law.  If you had said some, you would probably be\\ncorrect, however your tendency to exagerate and slant facts becomes\\napparent.  This slant permeates the text.\\n\\n%Practically all non-Jews who are living in or originate from areas\\n%under Israeli control, identify themselves as Palestinians. Most\\n%of them are Muslim, many are Christian. A few Jews, including the\\n%author of these lines, also identify themselves as Palestinians.\\n\\nThe above statement is not true.  Practically all - discounting\\nBeduins, Circassians, Druze, and some other fringe groups.\\nYour own identification is a matter that has no bearing upon the\\nissue.  You could equally identify yourself as a [insert group].\\n\\n%Zionism took off in Europe at the end of last century. It\\'s aim\\n%was to create a Jewish state in Palestine in spite of the adamant\\n%opposition of Palestinian Arabs (95% of the population).\\n\\nIf I recall correctly, at the time \"zionism\" took off, there\\nwas no adamant opposition in Palestine.  I am open to any\\nfactual contradictory evidence .\\n\\n%But the\\n%Zionists were more powerful, militarily, economically and\\n%technologically, and succeeded in 1948 in conquering 70% of the\\n%area of Mandatory Palestine. After driving into exile most native\\n%Arabs from the conquered areas, approximately 750,000 people, and\\n%razing most of their villages to the ground, the Zionists could\\n%finally establish a predominantly Jewish State. Only 150,000\\n%non-Jews remained on Israeli territory.\\n\\nDo you therefore contend that the 400 villages you mention further on \"most\\nof their villages\"?\\n\\n%Once the Jewish State was established, it began enacting laws to\\n%help the confiscation of land from native non-Jews, their\\n%political repression and their destitution.\\n\\nThere is no doubt that laws passed provided a framework which was later\\nused for these purposes.  However, you seem to imply that this was the\\nintention a priori, which implies a policy and agenda.  My knowledge was\\nthat this was not the case.\\n\\nYou also neglect to mention the circumstances that surrounded\\nthis.  As you do again, below.\\n\\n%In 1967 the State of Israel invaded Egypt and Syria and occupied\\n%the rest of Palestine (the West Bank and the Gaza strip). Thus\\n%another 1.5 million Palestinians fell under its juridiction. Its\\n%occupation of Palestinian and other Arab territories is considered\\n%illegal by the international community, as reflected in Security\\n%Council resolutions. Israel has rejected all U.N. resolutions and\\n%began without delay to entrench its occupation and rule over these\\n%territories with the aim of annexing them at the appropriate time.\\n\\nNot quite accurate.  Israel has not rejected all the resolutions,\\nthough it has conflicting understanding with regards to some of them.\\nIsrael never annexed the Sinai, West Bank, or Gaza.  The other\\nannexations were brought about partly due to the UN resolutions.\\n\\n%Part of these territores, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights,\\n%have already been forcefully annexed by Israel, in defiance of\\n%international law and UN resolutions.\\n\\nOut of curiousity, provided that the annexees are granted citizenship,\\nwhat int\\'l law do you claim prohibits annexation of territories\\ncaptured in war?  Has this ever been applied to any other country\\npreviously (other than Iraq) ?\\n\\n%It must be emphasized that, although these people live under\\n%different regimes, they are united in their self-perception as\\n%Palestinians, that is as people identifying with Palestine, a\\n%territorial entity (not an ethnic or religious entity).\\n\\nIncorrect! Palestinians themselves claim to be discriminated against\\non an \"ethnic or racial\" basis.  Therefore your above statement is\\nincorrect.\\n\\nI also note that given the previous definition of racial discrimination,\\nthe only means that you could argue for that is nationalistically.\\nHowever, no such nation has existed.  It definitely did not exist\\nat the time of the creation of Israel, in which case you can not\\nargue racial discrimination during that period!\\n\\n%Furthermore Palestinians generally consider the PLO both as a\\n%symbol of national identity and as the unchallenged authority that\\n%represents them in world affairs.\\n\\nOnce again, some do, some don\\'t.\\n\\n%The non-Jewish population living in the Palestinian and other Arab\\n%territories occupied by Israel in 1967 suffers not only blatant\\n%discrimination but is subject to brutal military occupation.\\n\\nAnother generalization, but then again, you don\\'t seem to care\\nabout anyone other than the Palestinian people, whose cause you\\nespouse.\\n\\n%licence, to start a business and to buy industrial equipment, the\\n%right to educate children, all of these basic rights are subject\\n%to arbitrary rulings by military authorities and cannot be\\n%challenged in court.\\n\\nIncorrect once again.  They have the ability to appeal.\\nFurthermore, although you may not agree with them, not all\\nof the military rulings are senseless or arbitrary.  Some\\nare, but this is not due to the \"whims\" of the military as\\nmuch as the sizeof the task/organization.\\n\\n%Only Jewish inhabitants of the occupied\\n%territories are permitted to carry firearms.\\n\\nIncorrect once again.  I know two Arab policemen who lived in\\nDaheisha and there were more.  Of course, with the outbreak of\\nthe intifada they were forced by the locals to resign, bitterly.\\n\\n%Jewish settlers have\\n%right to 6-7 more water per person than non-Jews. Jewish residents\\n%of these territories number now about 100,000 people. It is Israel\\n%governmentUs policy to increase this number substantially, in\\n%total defiance of international law, UN resolutions and the will\\n%of the population. The State of Israel systematically confiscates\\n%land from non-Jewish inhabitants of these territories for Jewish\\n%settlement.\\n\\nThat is no longer true, and I can\\'t help but wonder what your\\npurpose is/was in posting this.\\n\\n%Some 800,000 people in Israel proper,are not Jews. Most of them\\n%consider themselves Palestinians with Israeli citizenship. For\\n%many years after the establishment of Israel they were subjected\\n%to harsh military control. Much of their land was confiscated by\\n%the State and handed to Jewish organisations for exclusive Jewish\\n%settlement. They have been subject to massacres, destitution and\\n%humiliation. While they enjoy, with Jewish Israelis, the right to\\n%vote, they are discriminated against both through law and in\\n%practice.\\n\\nOnce again, to hell with the other minorities that don\\'t fit in,\\nright?  Their are many villages who did not suffer in the way\\nyou seem to indicate, Abu Gosh comes to mind.  Yes, some did but\\nas a result of what actions?\\n\\n%Approximately 92% of the surface of the State of Israel within the\\n%Rgreen lineS is for all purposes closed to Palestinians who are\\n%second-class citizens in Israel. They may neither legally live on\\n%such land, nor rent or cultivate it. A direct effect of these\\n%policies is that native non-Jewish citizens of Israel are denied\\n%residence and membership rights in most rural communities in\\n%Israel, including the collective settlements, kibbutzim. Non-Jews\\n%are discriminated against in many other ways: The Government\\n%starves local authorities of Palestinian villages and townships of\\n%funds; Jewish city councils force Palestinians to live in ghettos;\\n%Jewish families receive higher child allocations than their\\n%non-Jewish neighbors, Palestinian schools suffer underfunding and\\n%understaffing (as compared to Jewish schools); Palestinian\\n%children are denied the right to learn their history and\\n%literature; Israelis who struggle for equal rights and for the end\\n%of racial discrimination, suffer continuous harassment by the\\n%authorities.\\n\\n1.  There are some kibbutzim with Arab/Non-Jewish members.\\n    It is up to the members of the kibbutz.  There is no\\n    legislation against it, nor against a purely non-Jewish\\n    collective.\\n\\n2.  Funds are the result of political lobbying.  Bearing in mind\\n    that non_Jews compose ~20% of the voting population, it has\\n    never failed to amaze me that they fail to form one large\\n    bloc, and increase their power.  The recent elections are a case \\n    in point.\\n\\n3.  Please provide factual evidence supporting your allegation\\n    with regard to educational material.  You have obviously\\n    never seen the curriculum of a school in the West Bank.\\n    It is based upon Jordan\\'s school system.\\n\\n4.  With regard to your last statement, it is simply another\\n    gross generalization.  \\n\\n%The State of Israel refuses to acknowledge itself as the State of\\n%all its inhabitants.  Although the Israeli Cabinet has never\\n%openly endorsed the \\'transfer\\' idea (the forced removal from the\\n%country of its native Palestinian population, that is, its\\n%ultimate Judaization), Israeli government policies towards\\n%non-Jews bear the mark of this \\'Final Solution\\'. No attempt is\\n%made by the Zionist authorities to integrate Palestinian Arabs\\n%into Israeli public life. Thus, although comprising approximately\\n%17% of the population of Israeli citizens, no Palestinian citizen\\n%of Israel has ever served as Cabinet member, as director of \\n%ministry or of a national institution, as judge of the Supreme\\n%Court, as ambassador of Israel, or in any leading position in\\n%Israeli economic or financial life. Even the director of the\\n%Ministry for Arab Affairs - yes, such a thing exists! - is a Jew.\\n\\nAnother generalization, but lets not stop here.\\nThe transfer idea was espoused by one party in the last gov\\'t,\\nMoledet.  It was intended to be a solution to the problem in the\\nterritories, not the country itself.  With regard to other items,\\nI recall at least one Arab ambassador, and the rest was covered\\npreviously.\\n\\n%Although sexual\\n%relations between and cohabitation of Jews and non-Jews are legal,\\n%they are considered by Israeli/Zionist society somewhat a betrayal\\n%of the Jewish and Zionist ethics. The Israeli educational system\\n%nurtures this attitude in a systematic way.\\n\\nWhen was the last time you were in Israel?  That is simply not true,\\nnor has it been for quite some time.  The question of religious\\nintervention is best answered by the proportional representation and\\nthe lack of any Arab party bloc to counter the orthodox one.\\n\\n%Zionism rejects the idea of a modern secular state, based on\\n%equality of all citizens. This is one main reason why Israel has\\n%not produced any written Constitution. \\n\\nSimply incorrect.\\nThe answer is political.  Once again, your failure to understand the\\ndynamics and movements inside Israeli gov\\'t, relegates your\\ncontentions to the sidelines.\\n\\n%Zionism predicates a state\\n%where Jews have privileged rights. Thus, according to Israeli law,\\n%a Jew born in London, who has never visited Israel, does not speak\\n%Hebrew and professes atheism, is granted automatic Israeli\\n%citizenship, while native Palestinian inhabitants who happen to be\\n%Christian or Muslim, are treated almost as aliens.  Racial\\n%discrimination, as defined in international law, is thus not only\\n%reflected in Israeli laws and policies, but is grounded in the\\n%very nature of Israel as a Jewish state.\\n\\nBut the discrimination is not based upon race.\\nOops, sorry, nasty habit I have of countering malicious false truths.\\n\\n%Any proposal for Israeli-Arab and Israeli-Palestinian peace that\\n%does not address the issue of racial discrimination by Israel -\\n%that is the Zionist nature of the State of Israel - is thus doomed\\n%to fail.\\n\\nReal world intrusion - any proposal that does is doomed to fail.\\nOf course, I wouldn\\'t expect you to understand, wrapped up as\\nyou are in your VIEW of things.

Neil Schulman\\n\\nIf you wanted to know all about the Big Bang, you\\'d ring up Carl Sagan,\\nright ?  And if you wanted to know about desert warfare, the man to call\\nwould be Norman Schwarzkopf, no question about it.  But who would you call\\nif you wanted the top expert on American usage, to tell you the meaning\\nof the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution ?\\n\\nThat was the question I asked A.C. Brocki, editorial coordinator of the Los\\nAngeles Unified School District and formerly senior editor at Houghton\\nMifflin Publishers -- who himself had been recommended to me as the\\nforemost expert on English usage in the Los Angeles school system.  Mr.\\nBrocki told me to get in touch with Roy Copperud, a retired professor\\njournalism at the University of Southern California and the author of\\n\"American Usage and Style: The Consensus.\"\\n\\nA little research lent support to Brocki\\'s opinion of Professor Copperud\\'s\\nexpertise.\\n\\nRoy Copperud was a newspaper writer on major dailies for over three decades\\nbefore embarking on a a distinguished 17-year career teaching journalism at\\nUSC.  Since 1952, Copperud has been writing a column dealing with the\\nprofessional aspects of journalism for \"Editor and Publisher\", a weekly\\nmagazine focusing on the journalism field.\\n\\nHe\\'s on the usage panel of the American Heritage Dictionary, and Merriam\\nWebster\\'s Usage Dictionary frequently cites him as an expert.  Copperud\\'s\\nfifth book on usage, \"American Usage and Style: The Consensus,\" has been in\\ncontinuous print from Van Nostrand Reinhold since 1981, and is the winner\\nof the Association of American Publisher\\'s Humanities Award.\\n\\nThat sounds like an expert to me.\\n\\nAfter a brief telephone call to Professor Copperud in which I introduced\\nmyself but did not give him any indication of why I was interested, I sent\\nthe following letter:\\n\\n\"I am writing you to ask you for your professional opinion as an expert in\\nEnglish usage, to analyze the text of the Second Amendment to the United\\nStates Constitution, and extract the intent from the text.\\n\\n\"The text of the Second Amendment is, \\'A well-regulated Militia, being\\nnecessary for the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep\\nand bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\\'\\n\\n\"The debate over this amendment has been whether the first part of the\\nsentence, \\'A well-regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a\\nfree State\\', is a restrictive clause or a subordinate clause, with respect\\nto the independent clause containing the subject of the sentence, \\'the\\nright of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\\'\\n\\n\"I would request that your analysis of this sentence not take into\\nconsideration issues of political impact or public policy, but be restricted\\nentirely to a linguistic analysis of its meaning and intent.  Further,\\nsince your professional analysis will likely become part of litigation\\nregarding the consequences of the Second Amendment, I ask that whatever\\nanalysis you make be a professional opinion that you would be willing to\\nstand behind with your reputation, and even be willing to testify under\\noath to support, if necessary.\"\\n\\nMy letter framed several questions about the test of the Second Amendment,\\nthen concluded:\\n\\n\"I realize that I am asking you to take on a major responsibility and task\\nwith this letter.  I am doing so because, as a citizen, I believe it is\\nvitally important to extract the actual meaning of the Second Amendment.\\nWhile I ask that your analysis not be affected by the political importance of\\nits results, I ask that you do this because of that importance.\"\\n\\nAfter several more letters and phone calls, in which we discussed terms for\\nhis doing such an analysis, but in which we never discussed either of our\\nopinions regarding the Second Amendment, gun control, or any other political\\nsubject, Professor Copperud sent me the follow analysis (into which I have\\ninserted my questions for the sake of clarity):\\n\\n[Copperud:] \"The words \\'A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the\\nsecurity of a free state,\\' contrary to the interpretation cited in your\\nletter of July 26, 1991, constitutes a present participle, rather than a\\nclause.  It is used as an adjective, modifying \\'militia,\\' which is\\nfollowed by the main clause of the sentence (subject \\'the right\\', verb\\n\\'shall\\').  The to keep and bear arms is asserted as an essential for\\nmaintaining a militia.\\n\\n\"In reply to your numbered questions:\\n\\n[Schulman:] \"(1) Can the sentence be interpreted to grant the right to keep\\nand bear arms solely to \\'a well-regulated militia\\'?\"\\n\\n[Copperud:] \"(1) The sentence does not restrict the right to keep and bear\\narms, nor does it state or imply possession of the right elsewhere or by\\nothers than the people; it simply makes a positive statement with respect\\nto a right of the people.\"\\n\\n[Schulman:] \"(2) Is \\'the right of the people to keep and bear arms\\' granted\\nby the words of the Second Amendment, or does the Second Amendment assume a\\npreexisting right of the people to keep and bear arms, and merely state\\nthat such right \\'shall not be infringed\\'?\"\\n\\n[Copperud:] \"(2) The right is not granted by the amendment; its existence\\nis assumed.  The thrust of the sentence is that the right shall be\\npreserved inviolate for the sake of ensuring a militia.\"\\n\\n[Schulman:] \"(3) Is the right of the people to keep and bear arms\\nconditioned upon whether or not a well regulated militia, is, in fact\\nnecessary to the security of a free State, and if that condition is not\\nexisting, is the statement \\'the right of the people to keep and bear Arms,\\nshall not be infringed\\' null and void?\"\\n\\n[Copperud:] \"(3) No such condition is expressed or implied.  The right to\\nkeep and bear arms is not said by the amendment to depend on the existence\\nof a militia.  No condition is stated or implied as to the relation of the\\nright to keep and bear arms and to the necessity of a well-regulated\\nmilitia as a requisite to the security of a free state.  The right to keep\\nand bear arms is deemed unconditional by the entire sentence.\"\\n\\n[Schulman:] \"(4) Does the clause \\'A well-regulated Militia, being necessary\\nto the security of a free State,\\' grant a right to the government to place\\nconditions on the \\'right of the people to keep and bear arms,\\' or is such\\nright deemed unconditional by the meaning of the entire sentence?\"\\n\\n[Copperud:] \"(4) The right is assumed to exist and to be unconditional, as\\npreviously stated.  It is invoked here specifically for the sake of the\\nmilitia.\"\\n\\n[Schulman:] \"(5) Which of the following does the phrase \\'well-regulated\\nmilitia\\' mean: \\'well-equipped\\', \\'well-organized,\\' \\'well-drilled,\\'\\n\\'well-educated,\\' or \\'subject to regulations of a superior authority\\'?\"\\n\\n[Copperud:] \"(5) The phrase means \\'subject to regulations of a superior\\nauthority;\\' this accords with the desire of the writers for civilian\\ncontrol over the military.\"\\n\\n[Schulman:] \"(6) (If at all possible, I would ask you to take account the\\nchanged meanings of words, or usage, since that sentence was written 200\\nyears ago, but not take into account historical interpretations of the\\nintents of the authors, unless those issues can be clearly separated.\"\\n\\n[Copperud:] \"To the best of my knowledge, there has been no change in the\\nmeaning of words or in usage that would affect the meaning of the\\namendment.  If it were written today, it might be put: \"Since a\\nwell-regulated militia is necessary tot he security of a free state, the\\nright of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be abridged.\\'\\n\\n[Schulman:] \"As a \\'scientific control\\' on this analysis, I would also\\nappreciate it if you could compare your analysis of the text of the Second\\nAmendment to the following sentence,\\n\\n\"A well-schooled electorate, being necessary to the security of a free\\nState, the right of the people to keep and read Books, shall not be\\ninfringed.\\'\\n\\n\"My questions for the usage analysis of this sentence would be,\\n\\n\"(1) Is the grammatical structure and usage of this sentence and the way\\nthe words modify each other, identical to the Second Amendment\\'s sentence?;\\nand\\n\\n\"(2) Could this sentence be interpreted to restrict \\'the right of the people\\nto keep and read Books\\' _only_ to \\'a well-educated electorate\\' -- for\\nexample, registered voters with a high-school diploma?\"\\n\\n[Copperud:] \"(1) Your \\'scientific control\\' sentence precisely parallels the\\namendment in grammatical structure.\\n\\n\"(2) There is nothing in your sentence that either indicates or implies the\\npossibility of a restricted interpretation.\"\\n\\nProfessor Copperud had only one additional comment, which he placed in his\\ncover letter: \"With well-known human curiosity, I made some speculative\\nefforts to decide how the material might be used, but was unable to reach\\nany conclusion.\"\\n\\nSo now we have been told by one of the top experts on American usage what\\nmany knew all along: the Constitution of the United States unconditionally\\nprotects the people\\'s right to keep and bear arms, forbidding all\\ngovernments formed under the Constitution from abridging that right.\\n\\nAs I write this, the attempted coup against constitutional government in the\\nSoviet Union has failed, apparently because the will of the people in that\\npart of the world to be free from capricious tyranny is stronger than the\\nold guard\\'s desire to maintain a monopoly on dictatorial power.\\n\\nAnd here in the United States, elected lawmakers, judges, and appointed\\nofficials who are pledged to defend the Constitution of the United States\\nignore, marginalize, or prevaricate about the Second Amendment routinely.\\nAmerican citizens are put in American prisons for carrying arms, owning\\narms of forbidden sorts, or failing to satisfy bureaucratic requirements\\nregarding the owning and carrying of firearms -- all of which is an\\nabridgement of the unconditional right of the people to keep and bear arms,\\nguaranteed by the Constitution.\\n\\nAnd even the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), staunch defender of the\\nrest of the Bill of Rights, stands by and does nothing.\\n\\nit seems it is up to those who believe in the right to keep and bear arms to\\npreserve that right.  no one else will.  No one else can.  Will we beg our\\nelected representatives not to take away our rights, and continue regarding\\nthem as representing us if they do?  Will we continue obeying judges who\\ndecide that the Second Amendment doesn\\'t mean what it says it means but\\nmeans whatever they say it means in their Orwellian doublespeak ?\\n\\nOr will be simply keep and bear the arms of our choice, as the Constitution\\nof the United States promises us we can, and pledge that we will defend\\nthat promise with our lives, our fortuned, and our sacred honor ?\\n\\n(C) 1991 by The New Gun Week and Second Amendment Foundation.\\nInformational reproduction of the entire article is hereby authorized\\nprovided the author, The New Gun Week and Second Amendment Foundation are\\ncredited.

Shaw  (History),  who  recently\\ncompleted  two books:  The Jews  of  the Ottoman  Empire and  the\\nTurkish Republic, and Turkey and  the Holocaust: Turkey\\'s Role in\\nRescuing  Turkish  and  European  Jewry  from  Nazi  Persecution,\\n1933-45. Shaw  chairs the undergraduate  interdepartmental degree\\nprogram in Near Eastern Studies and has organized the Program for\\nthe Study of Ottoman and Turkish Jewry. He is affiliated with the\\nG. E. von Grunebaum Center for Near Eastern Studies.\\n\\nEditor: How did  you come to write these two  books on Turkey and\\nEuropean and Turkish Jews?\\n\\nShaw: Basically, I\\'m  an Ottoman historian, but  I\\'m also Jewish.\\nI\\'ve  spent twenty-five  years studying  Ottoman history,  and as\\ntime went along, whenever I  found materials on the Ottoman Jews,\\nI collected  them. But  I never  did anything  with them  until a\\ncouple of years  ago, when I suddenly realized that  1992 was the\\n500th  anniversary of  the  Jews being  expelled  from Spain  and\\ncoming  to Turkey.  Then the  Sephardic Temple  down on  Wilshire\\nAvenue invited me  to give a series of three  lectures on Ottoman\\nJewry.  These lectures  were  greatly appreciated,  and I  became\\nmotivated to  undertake further research  to develop a  book, The\\nJews of the  Ottoman Empire and the Turkish)  Republic. This book\\nis quite different from the  works of most Jewish historians, who\\ntend to look  at the Jews in any country  more from the viewpoint\\nof the Jews  and the Jewish community, and rely  mainly on Jewish\\nsources.  I  view my  subject  as  an  Ottoman historian,  and  I\\napproach the Jews of the Ottoman Empire largely from the point of\\nview of Ottoman  society, using largely Ottoman  sources. After I\\nfinished  this book  and  sent it  to the  press,  I came  across\\nadditional documents  relating to  Turkish Jews during  World War\\nII. In the completed book, I had said that Turkey had done a good\\ndeal  to rescue  the Jews  during  World War  II, but  I did  not\\nactually have many details. Then I  found a batch of documents in\\nthe Foreign Ministry archive relating to actions taken by Turkish\\ndiplomats to  help the Jews  before and during the  Holocaust. It\\nwas too late to add this new information to the book in press, so\\nI decided to  write a second book. I  conducted further research,\\nmainly in the archives of the  Foreign Ministry in Ankara and the\\nTurkish Embassy and Consulate in Paris. The result was the second\\nbook, Turkey and  the Holocaust, which details  how Turkey helped\\nrescue Jews from the Nazis.\\n\\n- How exactly did they do this?\\n\\nThe story takes  place over a number of years.  The book presents\\nthe material in three parts, first of which deals with the period\\nbefore the Holocaust. When the Nazis  came to power in Germany in\\n1933,  they immediately  started  dismissing  Jews and  anti-Nazi\\nGermans from universities,  hospitals, scientific institutes, and\\nthe like. Turkey at that moment was just beginning the process of\\nreforming its  universities, and it  saw in these Jews,  who were\\nbeing fired from their positions in Germany, a good source of new\\ntalent to  help modernize the Turkish  universities. Within three\\nmonths  after the  Nazis  started dismissing  these Jews,  Turkey\\narranged to take many of them in. They were brought to Turkey and\\nwere   given   appointments   as  professors   in   the   Turkish\\nuniversities, as  heads of scientific institutes,  and as medical\\npersonnel in hospitals. About 300  to 500 major Jewish professors\\ncame to  Turkey in  the 1930s. Ernst  Reuter, a  German political\\nscientist,  spent the  war  years teaching  political science  in\\nTurkey. After  World War II,  he was  mayor of Berlin  during the\\nBerlin Airlift.  Fritz Neimark, a major  German Jewish economist,\\ncame to Turkey and helped  establish a modern school of economics\\nin Istanbul.  A man named  Reichenbach, who was rescued  from the\\nNazis by  Turkey and  spent the war  years in  Turkey, eventually\\ncame to  UCLA, where he  became a professor of  philosophy. Other\\nGerman Jewish  emigres engaged in cultural  activities in Turkey.\\nOne  such was  Karl  Ebert,  who had  been  a leading  theatrical\\nproducer in Berlin until he was expelled by the Nazis. He went to\\nTurkey, where he  organized the Turkish National  Theater and the\\nTurkish National Opera  Company in Ankara, with the  help of Paul\\nHindemuth. So  the first  section of the  book covers  this first\\nphase, when Jews were being  persecuted in Germany and rescued by\\nTurkey.  Oddly enough,  the  German emigres,  when  they were  in\\nTurkey, did not seem to think too badly of Germany. They regarded\\nthemselves more  as Germans than Jews,  and they did not  join in\\nthe anti-Nazi activities of the local Turkish Jewish community. I\\neven  found  letters  from  the Nazi  representatives  to  Turkey\\npraising these German Jewish refugees for their work in promoting\\nthe idea  of German  culture. Even though  these people  had been\\npersecuted by the Nazis and rescued by the Turks, they shared the\\nNazis\\' feelings of  Aryan racial superiority over  the Turks. The\\nsecond part of the book deals  with the Holocaust, which began in\\n1940 when the Nazis occupied France.  In Europe at that time, and\\nespecially in France, there were  about 20,000 Turkish Jews. They\\nhad migrated to Europe for various reasons from about the turn of\\nthe century onward. Most of them had settled in Europe during the\\nTurkish war for  independence after World War I,  when Greece was\\nthreatening to overrun Turkey. The Greeks had persecuted the Jews\\nthroughout the nineteenth century, and the Jews feared what might\\nhappen to them if the Greeks  took over in Turkey. Many Jews fled\\nto France during  the 1920s and 1930s. Many  also abandoned their\\nTurkish  citizenship and  became  French  citizens. Suddenly  the\\nNazis invaded France in 1940 and started introducing all sorts of\\nanti-Jewish laws.  The Turkish  Jews soon found  that it  was not\\nworth very much to  be a French Jew, but that it  was worth a lot\\nto be a Turkish Jew.\\n\\n- How so?\\n\\nTurkey remained neutral through most of World War II. It retained\\nits embassies  and consulates in all  the Nazi-occupied countries\\nuntil it finally entered the war on the side of the Allies at the\\nend of 1944. During the war,  therefore, Turkey was in a position\\nto  defend its  citizens  against anti-Jewish  measures, and  the\\nactions that  Turkish diplomats took  form the second  chapter of\\nthe  book. Turkish  diplomats  who were  stationed  in France  in\\nparticular intervened to protect Jews of Turkish citizenship from\\nthe Nazis. For those Turkish  Jews who had retained their Turkish\\ncitizenship,  there  was  generally  no  problem.  If  they  were\\narrested and sent to a  concentration camp, the Turkish diplomats\\nwould  communicate with  the  commanders of  the  camp and  other\\nofficials and say in effect:  \"These people are Turkish citizens.\\nYou  can\\'t do  this  to  them.\" And  the  Turkish  Jews would  be\\nreleased.  If  their  businesses were  confiscated,  the  Turkish\\ndiplomats would protest and the businesses would be restored.\\n\\nThe Nazis  in general  wanted to keep  the friendship  of Turkey.\\nThey hoped to be able to use  Turkey as a gateway for an invasion\\nof the Middle  East, and they also wanted to  obtain chromium and\\nmanganese from Turkey. In order  to keep Turkish friendship, they\\nusually accepted  these interventions on behalf  of Turkish Jews.\\nThe Turkish  diplomats sometimes went to  the concentration camps\\nto secure the release of Turkish Jews. At times they even boarded\\ntrains hauling  Turkish Jews  to Auschwitz for  extermination and\\nsucceeded in getting them off the train. Most of the foreign Jews\\nwere sent  to a concentration  camp at  a place called  Drancy in\\nParis,  and that\\'s  where  most of  the  intercession by  Turkish\\nconsuls took place.\\n\\nThe greater problem came with  the Turkish Jews who had abandoned\\ntheir  Turkish citizenship  and had  become French  citizens. The\\nconsuls couldn\\'t declare that  these people were Turkish citizens\\nbecause  they were  not.  My book  includes  photographs of  Jews\\nlining  up in  front  of  the Turkish  consulate,  either to  get\\npassports to  return to Turkey or  to get a restoration  of their\\nTurkish  citizenship.   This  was   a  bureaucratic   matter,  so\\nprocessing the application would take  some time. In the meantime\\nit was a  real emergency, because the Nazis would  arrest Jews on\\nthe streets for almost nothing.  The Nazis would even arrest them\\nif they  had radios  or telephones  in their  apartments, because\\nradios and  telephones were  forbidden to Jews.  To take  care of\\nthese  former  Turkish Jews,  the  Turkish  diplomats invented  a\\ndocument called  gayri muntazem  vatandash, or  \"irregular fellow\\ncitizen.\" The  document said in  effect \"This person is  a former\\nTurkish  citizen  who has  applied  for  the restoration  of  his\\nTurkish citizenship.  In the meantime  we would appreciate  it if\\nyou  would treat  him  as  if he  were  a  Turkish citizen.\"  The\\ndiplomats wrote  the document in  Turkish and put their  seals on\\nit. Since  the Nazis could  not read  Turkish, on the  whole they\\naccepted  these papers  as certificates  of citizenship.  By this\\nmeans, the  Turkish diplomats were  able to rescue many  Jews who\\nhad relinquished their Turkish citizenship.\\n\\nActually the Nazis were of two minds about the Turkish defense of\\nJews. On the one hand the  Nazi Foreign Ministry, which wanted to\\nretain the friendship of Turkey,  was in favor of accepting these\\ninterventions. On the other hand, Himmler and Eichmann wanted all\\nJews exterminated.  At times  Himmler and  Eichmann were  able to\\nprevail and some  of the Turkish Jews were sent  off to Auschwitz\\nbefore the Turkish consuls could do anything.\\n\\n- Do you have statistics on how many Turkish Jews were rescued?\\n\\nThere were about  20,000 Turkish Jews in Europe  before world War\\nII,  about 10,000  of whom  were living  in France.  Most of  the\\ninformation in this section of  the book relates to the situation\\nin France. I have published  the letters that the Turkish consuls\\nsent to  the Nazi  officials and  the letters  that came  back in\\nreply. Generally the Nazis said  that if the Turkish consul would\\npresent  documents  certifying   that  arrested  individuals  are\\nTurkish citizens,  and promise  to send them  out of  France, the\\nNazis would release them from the concentration camp. The Turkish\\nconsuls also organized  special trains to take  Turkish Jews from\\nNazi-occupied  territory   back  to  Turkey.  These   trains  ran\\nregularly in 1943 and 1944. The Nazis gave the Turkish Jews visas\\nso they  could pass out  of Nazi  territory, but the  trains were\\noften  held  up by  the  Nazi-influenced  governments of  Eastern\\nEurope  -   Croatia,  Serbia,   and  Bulgaria  -   because  these\\ngovernments really didn\\'t want the Jews to escape. As a result of\\nthe Turkish consuls\\' efforts, about 3,000 to 4,000 of the Turkish\\nJews  in  France were  saved.  Another  3,000  were sent  off  to\\nAuschwitz, where  most of them  died. The remaining  3,000 either\\nescaped  across the  border into  Spain or  fled to  the area  of\\nsouthern France occupied  by the Italians, who  treated Jews much\\nbetter than  the Nazis did.  At the  end of 1943,  however, Italy\\nfell out of the war, and that was the end for those Jews as well.\\nIncidentally, the Turkish diplomats  in Nazi-occupied Greece also\\nworked to rescue Jews in that country.\\n\\n- The second part of your  book then deals with Turkish diplomats\\nacting to  rescue Jews of  Turkish citizenship or  Turkish origin\\nfrom Nazi persecution.\\n\\nYes,  and  there  is  an  aside   I  might  add  here:  In  their\\ninterventions on  behalf of Turkish  Jews, the Turks  cited their\\ntreaty with Germany which stated  that Turkish citizens in German\\nterritory would be treated the same as German citizens in Turkey.\\nOn  that basis  the Turks  maintained  that the  Nazis could  not\\ndiscriminate  against Turkish  citizens who  are Jews.  The Nazis\\nclaimed  (and the  Vichy government  agreed) that  they were  not\\ndiscriminating  because  they  were treating  all  Jews  equally.\\nTurkey  protested,   saying,  \"You  are  dividing   our  citizens\\naccording to religion, but the Turkish constitution requires that\\nall  citizens   be  treated  equally,  regardless   of  religion.\\nTherefore, you cannot single  out Turkish Jews.\" American consuls\\nin  Paris,  by contrast,  accepted  the  Nazi argument  and  told\\nAmerican Jews  who were being  persecuted by the Nazis  that they\\ncouldn\\'t do  anything about  it, because  the American  Jews were\\nbeing treated the same as other  Jews. The third part of the book\\ntakes place in Turkey, which  was the principal center during the\\nHolocaust for activities aimed at  the rescue of Eastern European\\nJews. The  kwish Agency, an  organization established by  Jews in\\nPalestine to help resettle Jews to Palestine, set up an office in\\nIstanbul  in 1940  under the  leadership of  Chaim Barlas.  Other\\nJewish organizations in Palestine, especially the kibbutzes, also\\nsent representatives  to Istanbul  to set up  headquarters. These\\ngroups first tried to contact Jews  in Eastern Europe to find out\\nwhat was  happening. Today  we know about  the Holocaust,  but at\\nthat  time people  didn\\'t know  what  was going  on. They  didn\\'t\\nimagine the Nazis could do the things they were doing. And so the\\nfirst step was to get information, and the Turkish government let\\nthem use the Turkish mails to send letters to their relatives and\\nfriends  in Eastern  Europe. The  Jewish organizations  found out\\nwhat was happening when they  received replies. Later on when the\\nNazis  began  to  intercept   such  letters,  the  Jews  received\\nassistance  also from  the  Vatican nuncio,  Angelo Roncali,  who\\nserved as  the Vatican  representative in  Istanbul from  1935 to\\n1944  and   later  became  Pope   John  XXIII.  As   the  Vatican\\nrepresentative  during the  war, he  used the  facilities of  the\\nCatholic  Church to  supplement what  the Turkish  government was\\ndoing to  assist Jewish  agencies in  contacting Jews  in Eastern\\nEurope.  With the  cooperation of  the Turkish  government, these\\nagencies  then  sent  hard  currency, food,  clothing,  and  even\\nrailroad  and  steamship  tickets   to  Jews  in  Czechoslovakia,\\nBulgaria, Romania, and Hungary. They weren\\'t able to help much in\\nPoland because  by then the  Nazis had  wiped out almost  all the\\nPolish Jews.  Whenever possible the rescue  agencies arranged for\\nthe Jews to get out of Eastern Europe either by train through the\\nso called  Orient Express route  to Istanbul, or by  boat through\\nthe Black Sea to Istanbul.\\n\\nTurkey was not eager for all  these refugees to remain within its\\nborders during  the war, because  it was being blockaded  and was\\nsuffering   terrible  shortages   of  food   and  clothing.   The\\ngovernment,   therefore,   facilitated   the  movement   of   the\\nnon-Turkish Jewish  refugees from Turkey to  Palestine, either by\\nthe Taurus  Express Railroad through  the mountains to  Syria and\\nPalestine,  or by  small boats  across the  eastern Mediterranean\\nfrom southern  Turkey to  Palestine. These efforts  were bitterly\\nopposed not only  by the Nazis, but also by  the British, who did\\nnot want  any more Jewish  immigration to Palestine  because they\\nfeared it would hurt their  relations with the Arabs. The British\\nconstantly pressured the Turkish  government to stop this traffic\\nand send those Jews back. In  a few cases the Turkish government,\\nyielding  to  British pressure,  did  send  the boats  back.  For\\nexample, in  one incident,  the steamship  Struma, with  some 700\\nJewish  refugees  from Romania,  was  sent  back by  the  Turkish\\ngovernment  as  a  result  of the  intervention  of  the  British\\nambassador. When  that ship was  sunk by a Soviet  submarine, all\\nwere lost except one person.  Nevertheless, all told, the Turkish\\ngovernment allowed no fewer than 100,000 Eastern European Jews to\\npass through  Turkish territory and  move on to  Palestine during\\nthe Second World War. The Turkish authorities also provided these\\nrefugees with facilities  and money, and gave  them permission to\\nsend money and food out of the country.\\n\\n- Many  of these  Jews who  passed  through Turkey  may still  be\\nliving in Israel.\\n\\nYes, and  their children. But  let\\'s return  for a moment  to the\\nfirst group, the Turkish Jews who  came from Europe. They did not\\ngo  on  to   Palestine;  they  stayed  in  Turkey.   It  was  the\\nnon-Turkish, Eastern  European Jews who passed  through Turkey en\\nroute to Palestine. Their story is very interesting.\\n\\n- And you have rescued it from obscurity.\\n\\nMany studies have been made of the Holocaust, but most of them do\\nnot focus on the Eastern European or Middle Eastern Jews. Most of\\nthe scholarship  has centered  on the  Western European  Jews, of\\nwhom 6 million were massacred by the Nazis. My study deals with a\\nmuch smaller  number of  people. I  have tried  to round  out the\\npicture,  and I  hope my  book  will persuade  other scholars  to\\nundertake further investigations in the history of Eastern Jews.\\n\\nWhen it  comes to numbers,  the German Jews were  also relatively\\nsmall in number. Most of the millions slain were Polish Jews. The\\nrescue  of  100,000  Eastern  European   Jews  may  not  seem  so\\nsignificant  compared  with  the  total of  6  million  who  were\\nmurdered, but it meant a lot to those who were saved.\\n\\nAbout  three-fourths   of  the  book  consists   of  documents  -\\ntranslations  of many  documents. They  are included  because the\\nstory is not well known. Not  only are people in the West unaware\\nof  the courageous  actions of  the Turkish  diplomats; even  the\\npeople of Turkey  did not know the story. I  felt that they would\\nnot  fully understand  this  remarkable  achievement unless  they\\ncould see the documents.\\n\\n- What languages are used in the documents?\\n\\nMost of them are in Turkish  or French; some are in Hebrew. There\\nis a great  deal of material in Hebrew about  the organization of\\nthe boats  going to Palestine, the  passengers, and so on,  but I\\ndid not go into those details extensively. I describe mostly what\\nTurkey did, so  most of my documents are in  Turkish or French. A\\nfew documents are  in English. The Jewish groups  in Istanbul did\\nnot necessarily  cooperate with  one another  to rescue  Jews; in\\nfact, they often fought with  one another. They took turns trying\\nto  get  the  Turkish  government to  deport  rival  groups.  For\\nexample, some of  the kibbutz groups felt that  the Jewish Agency\\nwas  run by  Western European  Jews who  were interested  only in\\nhelping  Western  European  Jews.  Finally,  in  1944,  President\\nRoosevelt sent a personal  representative, Ira Hirschman, who had\\nbeen an executive of Bloomingdale\\'s  department store in New York\\nCity, and  Hirschman managed to reconcile  their differences. The\\ndocuments related to his mission are in English.\\n\\nI also obtained many documents  from Serge Klarsfeld, a Holocaust\\nhistorian in France,  who mainly worked on the  French Jews. (His\\nfather was  killed by  the Nazis.)  He gave  me materials  he had\\ngathered in the German archives on  the Turkish Jews, so I didn\\'t\\npersonally consult the German archives.  I believe that much more\\ncan  be learned  from the  German  archives, and  I hope  someone\\nsomeday will make the effort.\\n\\n- This new book fits in well with your teaching, doesn\\'t it?\\n\\nRight. I\\'m  giving a  course on  the history of  the Jews  of the\\nOttoman  Empire.  I first  gave  the  course  two years  ago.  In\\naddition to  research, writing, and teaching,  I\\'ve been actively\\ninvolved in  the commemoration  of the  500th anniversary  of the\\ncoming of the  Jews to the Ottoman Empire. Among  other things, I\\nhelped organize  a large international conference  on the subject\\nwhich was held in Istanbul in 1992.\\n\\n- Now that your  books are finished and the  conference has taken\\nplace, what do you plan to do next?\\n\\nI\\'m working on two new books. One is a history of the Turkish War\\nfor Independence, which took place  after World War I, during the\\nyears  1918 to  1923. The  Turks warded  off the  efforts of  the\\nvictorious  European   powers  to  occupy  Turkey   and  end  its\\nindependence. The  second book is  a study of Sultan  Abdul Hamid\\nII, the last major sultan, who ruled from 1876 to 1909. He was an\\nimportant modernizer in his own  way, although he also suppressed\\nall sorts of political movements.\\n\\nStanford  J. Shaw  received  a B.A.  in History  and  an M.A.  in\\nBritish History. He then shifted to Near Eastern History, earning\\na second M.A.  and a Ph.D. at Princeton. As  a doctoral candidate\\nat Princeton, he  spent two years abroad, studying  at the School\\nof  Oriental  and  African  Studies, University  of  London;  the\\nUniversity of  Cairo, the American  University at Cairo,  and the\\nUniversity of  Istanbul. He  taught at  Harvard before  coming to\\nUCLA in 1966. His postdoctoral research has been supported by the\\nJohn Simon Guggenheim Foundation, the American Research Institute\\nin  Turkey, the  Social  Science Research  Council, the  National\\nEndowment for the Humanities, the Fulbright Program, and ISOP. He\\nhas  received  honorary  degrees   from  Harvard  University  and\\nBosporus University, Bebek, Istanbul, Turkey, and medals of honor\\nfor lifetime contributions  to the fields of  Islamic and Turkish\\nstudies from the Center for Research in Islamic History, Art, and\\nCulture in  Istanbul and from  the American Friends of  Turkey in\\nWashington,  D.C. In  addition to  undertaking many  professional\\nservice activities and public lectures  in both the United States\\nand Turkey,  Shaw has  also produced eight  books and  one edited\\nvolume. His  History of  the Ottoman Empire  and Modem  Turkey (2\\nvols.)  has been  published  in many  editions  (six editions  or\\nreprints  from 1977-1991),  and  translated  into Turkish  (1983,\\n1991) and French (1984). His book  The Jews of the Ottoman Empire\\nand  the  Turkish  Republic  (MacMillan,  London,  and  New  York\\nUniversity Press, 1992) will  be published in Turkish translation\\nby the Turkish  Historical Society, Istanbul. His  Turkey and the\\nHolocaust: Turkey\\'s  Role in Rescuing Turkish  and European Jewry\\nfrom Nazi  Persecution, 1933-1945 will be  published by Macmillan\\nPublishers,  London, and  New York  University Press  in 1993.

       " ':\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen McManus says, \"We have the world\\'s best medical care,\" I can hardly\\nbelieve he\\'s referring to a system:\\n\\n1.  That costs us 14 percent of our GDP, while there isn\\'t a\\n    single other country in the industrialized world that spends more than\\n    10 percent.\\n\\n2.  That leaves 37 million of us with no coverage, even though all\\n    the other systems in the industrialized world cover virtually everyone.\\n\\n3.  Yet, Americans rank near the bottom of the list in terms of life\\n    expectancy, childhood immunization rate, infant mortality, and many\\n    preventable diseases.\\n\\n4.  We pay, on average, about $1000 each for MRIs.  (To put that in\\n    perspective, they cost $177 in Japan.)\\n\\n5.  The average US company spends over 2500 dollars a year per employee on\\n    health benefits.  Seven hundred to 1500 is the range just about everywhere\\n    else.\\n\\n\\nHow can anyone say that such a system is the best in the world?  The only\\nthing the USA health care system is good at is showering well-insured patients\\nwith a champagne treatment of care and outrageously overcharging for it.  And\\nthe \"private\" system of insurers and paperwork is so bloated and inefficient\\nthat it itself sucks up over 100 billion dollars a year in money from every\\nother sector of society - individuals, government, and industry.\\n\\nOf the < 800 billion dollars Americans threw into the bottomless pit of health\\ncare costs last year, the Consumer\\'s Union estimated that at least 200 billion\\nwas thrown away on overpriced, useless, and even downright harmful tests and\\nprocedures, and the most bureaucratic, regulated insurance system in the world.\\n\\nThere are more than 1200 different private insurers in the USA.  But did the\\n\"private competition\" stimulate more efficient paperwork?  Ask any doctor\\nwho\\'s had to hire a full-time clerk to deal with it all!\\n\\nThe competition among hospitals is driving costs UP, not down.  The\\ncompetition among hospitals for both doctors and patients has encouraged the\\nhospitals to traffic in expensive superfluous equipment.  Spending millions on\\nexpensive machines of dubious value that spend 80 percent of the day idle\\nisn\\'t my idea of the world\\'s best health care system.\\n\\nCompetition among specialists is driving them to perform dangerous and\\nexpensive procedures where they are very marginally helpful.  I\\'m especially\\nthinking of heart surgery and some women\\'s surgeries like hysterectomy and\\nCesarean section.  Sound like the world\\'s best health care system?\\n\\n\\n\\nEver notice how, every time someone tries to bring about some real change in\\nhealth care, the Libbies start bashing Canada\\'s system?  First of all, Hillary\\nClinton is not advocating another Canadian system.  I think that\\'s been made\\nabundantly clear in the news for the last couple of months.  Where did John F.\\nMcManus get that idea, anyway?\\n\\nLet\\'s say you\\'re a Canadian living in a small town near the USA border.  Your\\nchild needs a complicated procedure only available in city hospitals.  The\\nnearest Canadian cities are 6 hours west and 20 hours east, and there\\'s an\\nAmerican city one hour south.  Which way are you going to go?  Is it because\\nthe American system is the \"best\" in the world, or just for convenience?\\n\\nIt still amazes me that people can\\'t seem to see more than just black and\\nwhite on health care reform.  There are a million different ways we ould\\nrestructure the system.  It\\'s not just a choice between total government\\ncontrol and total private control.  I wish the people screaming \"socialized\\nmedicine\" every time soemone wants to change the current syste would INFORM\\nTHEMSELVES on health care issues.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe current system sucks.  I want to keep providers private but that doesn\\'t\\nchange the fact that we will never be able to deal with the deficit if we\\ndon\\'t REFORM THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM.  Purely private health care without any\\ngovernment intervention doesn\\'t work.  Hillary Clinton is not thinking of\\nnationalizing providers or evern insurers.  How can you scream \"socialized\\nmedicine\" at her programs?  Don\\'t you even know what you\\'re talking about?\\n\\n\\n\\nEver see Clinton\\'s graphs of projected deficit versus year for the rest of the\\ndecade?  Notice how the line falls, then starts increasing?  Why?  I\\'ll give\\nyou one wild guess as to which component of spending will overwhelm us if we\\ndon\\'t do something about it.\\n\\n\\n\\nPEOPE JUST DOESN\\'T GET IT.  The current health care system is a cancer which is\\nkilling our economic well-being.  Costs are still rising 10 percent a year\\neven as Americans by the tens of millions go without, or are forced into\\nmanaged-care programs, which are certainly pretty socialized already if you\\nask me.\\n\\nA couple of months ago I posted a message asking any Hillary-bashers to please\\ncome forward and present (no gimmicks, straight talk) just how THEY would set\\nabout keeping costs down.  I didn\\'t get a single answer.\\n\\nThe only thing I keep hearing from Libbie organizations are press releases\\nfilled with evasive platitudes like \"give health care back to the people.\"\\nJust do you expect to do that without serious reforms?  What is it about the\\ncurrent system that you would change and how would that help?\\n\\n\\nHow can anyone read the news, live under our system, and NOT see these faults?\\nHow can we deal with the deficit, our cities, our educational system, our\\ninfrastrucure, AIDS, modernizing our industry, etc. if we don\\'t quit throwing\\naway money which could be used to SOLVE those problems?\\n\\n\\nAmerica needs health care reform NOW.

The dealer\\ntold us it is because to change the oil filter on a SVX it is necessary to\\ndisassemble a metal cover under the engine and that took an hour of labour.\\nAt first, we think we are being ripped off so she phone to a dealer in Toronto\\nbut found out the they are charging roughly the same price.  So is there any\\nSVX owner out there that has the same problem ?  And if the oil change story is\\ntrue, then the engineer of Subaru looks pretty stubid to me. By the way, the car\\nlooks great.',\n",

This impressive change in the province\\'s ethnic character \\n notwithstanding, there was, on the eve of the creation of the Armenian \\n Republic, a solid block of 370,000 Tartars who continued to dominate the \\n southern districts, from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia.\" \\n (See also Map 1.

Basic ANTI-TRUST law says\\nthat, while you can purchase IBM stocks for the purpose of\\ninvesting, you can not acquire a large number of those\\nshares with the intent or controlling IBM. You can do so\\nonly if you make your intentions CLEAR apriori . Clearly,\\nthe Jews who purchased properties from palastenians had some\\ndesigns, they were not buying a dwelling or a real estate.\\nThey were establishing a bridgehead for the European Jews.\\n\\nThe palastenians sold their properties to the Jews in the\\nold tradition of arab hospitality. Being a multi-ethnic /\\nmulti-religious society, accepting the jews as neighbours\\nwas no different, just another religion. Plus they paid fair\\nmarket value, etc... They did not know they were victims of\\nan international conspiracy. (I'm not a conspiracy theorist\\nmyself, but this one is hard to dismiss).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAgain Adam, the devil is in the details. I don't want to get\\non a tangent here but its the same reasonning that says its\\nOK to return 100 deportes and leave the rest. Because 100 is\\na nice number that you can devide by 10, 100 and besides, it\\nhas an integer square root.\\n\\n\\n\\nDo you actually believe this? My experience tells me that\\nevery palestinian I knew still keeps the key to his home, in\\nPalestine. Besides they often refer to their exodus as an\\nescape from hell (so to speak). I know none that agrees with\\nyou. Did you sample their opinions? I know you don't care,\\njust being rethorical.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDon't get me wrong. I beleive that Israel is democratic\\nwithin the constraints of one dominant ethnic group (Jews).\\nIsrael probably had a few options after 1948: ethnic\\ncleansing Serbian style, and deserve the wrath of the\\ninternational community, or make the best out of a no win\\ncondition: show the world how good Israel is towards the\\n'bad' arabs. Personaly, I've never heard anything about the\\narab community in Isreal. Except that they're there.  So\\nyes, they're there. But as a community with history and\\nroots, its dead.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI stand corrected. I meant that the jewish culture was not\\npredominant in Palestine in recent history.

The notion that coercion can\\nbe virtually eliminated in a society (or more properly that once it is\\neliminated on the part of the state it is no longer worth serious \\nconsideration) is a view that is peculiar to libertarians and anarchists.  \\n\\nFor example, does \"non-initiated force\" (coercion) include tax collection?\\nDoes it include the minimal level of regulation of commerce envisioned\\nby Adam Smith?

It was known to the Syrians as Armenia and to the Arabs\\nas Ermeniyye.\\n \\nOthers believe that Urartu was known in the time of the Medes as \\'Harminap\\'\\nwhich was later modified by the Persians to \\'Arminia\\'. \\'Ar\\' refers to a\\nplace, as in Ararat, Archish, Aruyr, Archar, Arshav, Arazen and Aror, \\nwhile \\'men\\' is used to refer to spirit, thought or human being, and \\ntherefore \\'Armen\\' would appear to signify \\'the people of that place\\'.\\n\\nG. Alishan believes that \\'according to our national vocabulary \"Haik\"\\nis the diminutive form of \"Hai\", and that \"Hai\" is the name of our\\nnation. Our nation is in no way connected with the word \"Armen\" that\\nforeigners apply to our people.\\'\\n\\nIt would thus appear that \\'Armenia\\' is a place-name, that \\'Armen\\' is \\nthe name of the people who lived there, and that these are in no way\\nconnected with the word \\'Hai\\'.\\n\\nHaik and Haiastan:\\n\\nArmenian historians believe Haik to have been a great hero from whom\\nthe Armenian people took the name \\'Hai\\'. But the mere resemblance\\nbetween the words \\'Haik\\' and \\'Hai\\' constitutes no real proof, and,\\nin any case, no such theory appears before the time of Moses of\\nKhoren.\\n\\nHaiasa:\\n\\nThe following studies show quite clearly that \\'Hai\\' and \\'Haiasa\\' were\\nno more than general names used by the Hittites to refer to the \\nregion known as Armenia.\\n\\nProfessor Hachadurian: \\'Haiasa was the general name used in Hittite\\ninscriptions for Upper Armenia.\\'\\n\\nYensen, in his \\'Hittites and Armenians\\' tries to prove that \\'Hai\\' is\\nidentical with the Hittite \\'Hatio\\', in other words that \\'Hai\\' is a\\nHittite word. Research, however, has proved this erroneous, and shown\\nthat \\'Hai\\' was derived from \\'Hatio\\'.\\n\\nMortman\\'s attempt to read the Urartu inscriptions as Armenian met with \\nno success. As for Greek, there is no point in even mentioning it.\\n\\nThe resemblance between the words \\'Haiasa\\' and \\'Haiastan\\' is so obvious\\nthat we may well accept \\'Haiasa\\' as the oldest form of \\'Haiastan\\'.\\n\\nLet us now cast a brief glance on how the words \\'Hai\\', \\'Haikazan\\' and\\n\\'Haiastan\\' entered our older works.\\n\\nAccording to Karakashian: \\n\\n\\'The word \"Haik\" is never to be found employed with reference to a\\nleader of the Armenian people prior to Moses of Khoren, nor is it\\never found employed in the forms \"Haika\" or \"Haykazn\".\\n\\nAgahangelos and Puzant use the word as a title or a place-name (he\\nimproved and developed Haiastan, etc.). If the word had referred\\nto a nation and had been derived from \"Hai\" or \"Haik\" they could \\nalso have used the words \"Haikak\" and \"Haykazn\" in a number of\\nplaces.\\'\\n\\nAccording to Professor Sayce, who deciphered a number of Hittite \\ninscriptions:\\n\\n\\'In the Hittite language the suffix -ha is used to specify quality\\nor species. The words \"Haddanas\", \"Haddina\" were used by the \\nAssyrians to refer to the Hittites. With the transformation of the\\n\"d\" between the two \"a\" letters to \"y\" \"Hadinasdani\" was in this\\nway transformed to \"Haiastan\"\\'.\\n\\nProfessor Grechmer fully agrees with this point of view, but regards\\nthe significance and explanation so far accorded to the terms \\'Hai\\'\\nand \\'Haistan\\' as quite unsatisfactory. He finds, however, that a \\nsolution to this problem is brought nearer by the name \\'Haiasa\\' \\nwhich is so frequently found in Bogazkoy from 1400 B.C. onwards.\\nForrer takes \\'Haiasa\\' as referring to Upper Armenia. In that case\\nit seems likely that \\'Haiasa\\' was actually a part of Armenia. The\\nsuffix -dan is of Anatolian origin. The real root is \\'Hayasa\\', which\\nrefers to the country of the \\'Hayasas\\'.\\n\\nE. Chantre writes as follows on the subject of the ethnological \\nand Anthropological characteristics of the Armenian people.\\n\\nThe Armenians in Russia may be characterized as follows: Almost\\nall of them are brachycephalic or leptocephalic, very dark,\\nabove average height, an Aissores Asian group with close ties\\nwith certain Kurdish tribes and Azerbaijan peoples.\\n\\nAccording to J. Deniker:\\n\\nFrom the philological point of view, the Armenian and Kurds may be\\nregarded as belonging to the Iranian group...The Armenians are \\ndescended from various elements and from a very mixed race. Their\\naverage height varies between 1.63 and 1.69 according to the region.\\nThey are almost always short-headed, with skull measurements of \\n85-87. As a race they belong to the Indo-Afghan-Assyrian-Turkic\\nfamily.\\n\\nProfessor Rene Vernont writes as follows:\\n\\nThe Armenians are a mixture of Semites, Turk, Kurds and Mongols,\\nbut some of them display Armenian features, e.g., height a little\\nabove average, fair complexion, dark hair, dark eyes, very often\\na hooked nose and a rather wide mouth. \\n\\nInvestigations carried out by N.

       " 'Review of 1989 Ford Taurus SHO -- By Gene Kim\\n=============================================\\n\\nBackground:\\n\\n    Last week, I bought a 1989 Ford Taurus SHO, moving up from driving\\na 1987 Toyota Celica ST and a 1975 Oldsmobile Cutlass.  I have been\\ninterested in buying a SHO for about five months and have been combing\\nthe classifieds in Denver and Chicago every week.  I bought a\\nremarkably clean maroon/red SHO with 92K miles on it for $6800.\\nAs far as I can tell, this is about $2000 under Blue Book and I still\\nhave another 8000 miles before the Extended Service Plan runs out.\\n\\n    As one should with any pre-1991 SHOs, I made sure that the car was\\nalready refit with the upgraded clutch and pressure plate, as well as\\nhaving been recalled for upgraded rotors and seatbelt attachments.\\nHowever, my SHO does not have the newer rod shifter -- I understand I\\ncan get this for $230 from any Ford service center.  In addition, the\\ncar received the full tune-up at 60K miles, receiving new platinum\\nplugs and valve adjustment.\\n\\n    For a car with 92K miles on it, the car was virtually immaculate.\\nThe clearcoat paint job was devoid of any large chips or dents,\\nalthough the front air-dam/molding was covered with lots of small\\nscratches -- not surprising since most of the miles were spent on the\\nhighway.\\n\\n    Having driven a smaller two-door coupe for so long, I was a bit\\nconcerned about whether I could get used to driving a larger car.  To\\nmy surprise, the size of the car doesn\\'t bother me at all -- it seems\\njust as nimble as my Celica!  (No comparisons with my Oldsmobile.  :-)\\nVisibility from the driver\\'s seat is excellent, helped mostly by of\\nthe small the quarter-windows, aft of the back-seat door windows and\\nin front of the C-pillar and rear window.  Parallel parking is a bit\\nmore difficult, but other than that, I love the size.\\n\\n    In fact, I\\'m starting to appreciate the large trunk as I pack up\\nfor a 14-hour drive to Washington, DC for the summer.  More on the\\nride later in this review.\\n\\n\\nEngine:\\n    \\n    As with anyone even slightly interested in SHOs, I was very\\ninterested in the 24-valve 3.0L Yamaha \"Shogun\" engine.  I was not\\ndisappointed.  Base performance of the engine under 4000 rpms is\\ngood.  You can even do reasonable launches from second gear, although\\nI don\\'t make a practice of this.  The engine revs smoothly and eagerly\\n-- tooling around town does not require many shifts.  This is good\\nsince the shifter is definitely one of the weakest points of the car.\\n(More on this later.)\\n\\n    While the performance of the engine under 4000 rpms may be\\nunremarkable, it undergoes a Jekyll/Hyde transformation once you hit\\nhigher revs.  At 4500 rpms, a butterfly valve opens and you can\\nliterally hear and feel the geometry of the engine changing as twelve\\nmore valves open up.  The engine soars to its 7000 rpm redline, and\\nyou are treated to, in my opinion, the sweetest sounding V6 around.\\nThe engine inexplicably sounds OVERJOYED to be at 6500 rpm!\\n\\n    I\\'ve noticed that when I drive around town, I constantly watch the\\ntach to see how far below 4000 rpm I am.  To go from 2000 rpm to 4000,\\nyou may have to punch the accelerator -- while torque is more than\\nadequate, it doesn\\'t come fully online until those other 12 valves\\nare used.\\n\\n\\nTransmission:\\n\\n    When _Car and Driver_ first reviewed the car in 1988, they\\nmarvelled at how Ford had put such a wimpy clutch and balky shifter\\ninto the car.  I remember driving a friend\\'s parent\\'s SHO in 1990, and\\nremember thinking about whether I had the leg strength to drive the\\ncar in traffic -- the clutch was that stiff.  That was back then.\\n\\n    The entire clutch assembly on my SHO has been replaced under a\\nFord recall in 1991.  The clutch on the SHO feels no stiffer than the\\none on my Toyota Celica.  In fact, the friction point seems a bit\\nlarger and more forgiving.\\n\\n    When playing with the shifter with the car parked, the shifter\\nfelt very reasonable.  The 1-2 and 3-4 gates were where you\\'d expect\\nit to be, and the shifting action was smooth.  On the road, it\\'s\\nmuch the same -- but you have to shift SLOWLY!  Make no mistake, it\\'s\\na clumsy shifter.\\n\\n    When hurrying shifts, like when I was initially trying to impress\\nfriends, I consistently miss the 1-2 shift, often grope clumsily for\\nthe 2-3 shift, and sometimes even muff the 3-4 shift.  I find this\\npretty amazing in a car like this.\\n\\n    It also took me several days to realize that you get the smoothest\\nshifts when you take your time.  Seems obvious, but compared to my\\nToyota and my friend\\'s Honda, this seems atrocious and clumsy.\\nSomeone on rec.autos noted that CRXs should blow SHOs off-the-line\\nbecause of the incredibly clumsy shifter.\\n\\n    I now shift much more sedately, and the shifter seems more\\nreasonable.  When you play within these bounds, the shifter works\\nsmoothly with no surprises.  I don\\'t know whether the rod shifter\\nupgrade would help at all.\\n\\n    Along these same lines, I initially had trouble shifting gears\\nsmoothly.  Again, slowing down the shifts and taking more care to\\nmatch revs when letting out the clutch helped immensely.  This took\\nseveral days for me to get the hang of.  (I think some of my problems\\nwere because I\\'ve never had a car with enough power to balk at bad\\nshifts in higher gears.)\\n\\n    Occasionally, I have trouble shifting into reverse.  The shifter\\nrefuses to enter the gate, and I often grind the synchros trying to \\nget it into gear.  I\\'ll be watching this carefully in the next couple\\nof months.\\n\\n    A quirk:  When I upshift and the engine drops back to 1000-2500\\nrpm, I hear a whirring and then a grinding noise coming from the the\\nengine compartment.  Not terribly loud, but the passenger can\\ndefinitely hear it.  I asked about it when I was looking at the car,\\nas do all my passengers.  Apparently, this is a definitely a \"SHO\\nsound\" and is the gearbox -- apparently called \"gear rollover\".\\nReplies to my queries on rec.autos are at the end of this review.\\n\\n\\nExterior:\\n\\n    As I mentioned before, I am astounded by how well the body of this\\nSHO has stood up.  Paint chipping on the front bumper and grille are\\nvirtually non-existent.  Looking at how older Tauri sometimes\\ndon\\'t age so gracefully, I wonder what the guys at Ford did\\ndifferently to the SHO bodies.\\n\\n    The body, in my opinion, is extremely attractive with matching\\ncolor body moldings than the stock Tauri.  For some odd reason, the\\nSHO seems different enough from vanilla Tauri to get stares at\\nstoplights -- of course, this could be my overactive imagination.\\n:-)  SHOs get fog lights, a more open grille, a completely\\nmonochromatic exterior, and a deeper ground skirt in the back with\\n\"SHO\" stenciled in relief.  I\\'ve seen a couple SHOs whose owners have\\ncolored these in with florescent colors or in black.  Yuck.\\n\\n    I don\\'t think the car is flashy.  I like it that way.  I feel\\nalmost anonymous with all those Tauri out there, but different and\\ndistinctive enough to those of us who care.  :-)\\n\\n\\nInterior:\\n\\n    The interior is what really makes me feel like I don\\'t deserve the\\ncar.  The seats are grey leather, the steering wheel and shifter are\\ncovered with black leather, and the entire instrument panel is done in\\na black/grey/metallic scheme.  \\n\\n    The instrumentation is stock Taurus, except for the 140 mph speedo\\nand 8000 rpm tach.  You get a center console with two cupholders, a\\nlarge compartment under the radio (great for a CD player), an armrest\\nthat contains yet another compartment, three appropriately sized coin\\nholders for tollways (I think), and a compartment for holding\\ncassette tapes.  There\\'s map-holders in the doors, and an oddly small\\nglove compartment.\\n\\n    I spilled a whole can of Coke in the cupholder and was delighted\\nto find that the entire rubber holder can be removed and washed in a\\nsink.  Hey, I\\'m really impressed with the ergonomics and\\nthoughtfulness that went into its design.  And it\\'s a 1989, before the\\ninterior was upgraded!\\n\\n    The backseat is bigger than any car I\\'ve had.  Why do they need so\\nmuch space?  :-)  (No smart-ass comments, please.  :-)\\n\\n    The driver and passenger seat have lumbar and side bolsters.  From\\nwhat I hear, it\\'s not uncommon for the side bolsters to show wear.\\nMine is no exception.  The left side bolster on the driver\\'s has\\ncracked and I\\'m not convinced the right bolster is inflating all the\\nway.\\n\\n    A big surprise for me:  I forgot that SHOs don\\'t have a normal\\nhand parking brake.  Instead, they have the regular parking brake that\\nyou press with your left foot.  Too bad.  Again, I\\'m getting used to\\nit, but it seems a bit anachronistic to me.\\n\\n\\nRide:\\n\\n    The suspension is nice and stiff.  Too stiff?  It\\'s stiffer than\\nany car I\\'ve had.  A friend\\'s new 1993 Toyota Celica ST seems tauter\\nand is still able to soak up bumps better.  The SHO seems stiffer with\\nless ability to soak up bumps.  Driving over railroad tracks is a\\nnoisy and jarring affair.  On the other hand, taking turns feels\\nwonderful because the body is so rigid and doesn\\'t flex at all -- I\\nlistened for that before I bought the car.\\n\\n    On the highway, the ride is great.  When I drove the car from\\nChicago back to Purdue, I had trouble keeping under 85 mph, let alone\\nfrom trying to see what 100 mph really feels like.  It\\'s a relatively\\nquiet ride, but the sunroof rattles.  I\\'ve tried to find out what\\nexactly makes all the noise up there, but it seems to be the window\\nthat rests on the rails.  No easy way to get rid of it, I think.\\n\\n    Over the past three days, I\\'ve oscillated between thinking the\\nsuspension is wonderful and perfect and thinking that the ride is way\\ntoo rough.  (Not for me, mind you.  But I wonder whether I would\\nadvise my dad to buy one for himself.)  But, I\\'ve discovered, as with\\nthe shifter, if you take your time with shifts, you\\'ll have no reason\\nto complain.  Let me explain...\\n\\n    The ride is worst when turning and applying lots of power to the\\nwheels.  I feel the wheels scrabbling for traction and torque steer\\nmaking the car skitter left and right.  After I understood this, I\\navoid the limits of traction -- and I\\'m a happy camper again.\\n\\n    It\\'s not body rigidity, but the composure of the car.\\n\\n    As if matching the suspension, the steering feel is quite heavy.\\nMy first impression of driving my SHO was how hard you had to turn the\\nwheel at highway speeds.  It tracks straight as an arrow, but when\\ndriving around a parking lot, the high-effort steering didn\\'t seem so\\nuseful.  However, it\\'s reasonable, but it doesn\\'t communicate the road\\nto the driver as well as a 1993 Ford Probe GT.  IMHO, it\\'s much better\\nthan the steering on my Celica ST.\\n\\n    I wonder how bad this car is during winter?\\n\\n\\nMiscellaneous notes:\\n\\n    GRIPES:\\n\\n    The rattles from the sunroof is intermittent -- some days it rattles\\n        loudly, other days I look up wondering where all the noise went.\\n\\n    Activating the sunroof is sometimes very noisy -- loud squealing as\\n\\tit retracts on its rails.  I wonder if there is a quick fix for this.\\n\\tAgain, other days it completely disappears.  (Function of humidity?)\\n\\n    Once I made the connection between the sometimes awful feeling suspension\\n\\tand torque steer, I\\'ve never complained about ride.\\n\\n    I wish the seats had more support under the thighs.  Also, I wish the\\n\\tside bolsters would close more tightly.  \\n\\n    I hear that tires for this car can get really expensive.  I\\n\\tcurrently have Goodyear GT+4s that cost the previous owner $500\\n\\tfor four.\\n\\n    I used to hate the Ford stereo systems -- whose idea was it\\n\\tto use a volume *paddle*?  Now, to my amazement, I don\\'t\\n\\treally mind...  and sometimes think it\\'s an okay idea!!!\\n\\tPretty ridiculous, though.\\n\\n    Getting up to 4000 rpm sometimes seems to be a chore.  But,\\n\\tthis is no big deal.  There is more than enough torque\\n\\tdown low.\\n\\n    I often goof up the shifting when driving with friends.  It\\n\\ttook me a couple of days before I could really shift\\n\\tsmoothly from 2nd to 3rd gear.  (Hard to believe, isn\\'t it?)\\n\\n    My car has almost 93,000 miles on it.  My parents noted that\\n\\tit is almost impossible to find a low-mileage SHO. \\n\\tAstute observation, IMHO.  I wonder how long I can make\\n\\tmy SHO last -- I just bought a book titled \"Drive It Forever\"\\n\\tfor tips in this department.  :-)\\n\\n    The goofy parking brake pedal still throws me for a loop.  I once\\n\\tparked the car in gear, and then accidentally let out the clutch\\n\\tafter I started it.  The car jolted forward, and bounced off\\n\\tthe car in front of me -- no paint damage at all, but starting the car \\n\\tis a whole new ritual for me with that fangled pedal!  Also, I began \\n\\tto wonder how strong that brake really is.  (Today, I backed out of \\n\\tparking spot today and started to drive away before I noticed \\n\\tthe glowing brake light.  Oops.)\\n\\n    The driver\\'s power window creaks when closed all the way.  The same\\n    \\tthing happens in my parents 1989 Mercury Sable.  Oddly, all the\\n\\tother windows work smoothly.\\n\\n\\n    LIKES:\\n\\n    I\\'m liking the interior amenities more and more each day.  The\\n    \\tcupholders are great.\\n\\n    I didn\\'t expect to use the keyless entry buttons so much, but\\n\\tit really is handy.  You can lock all the doors by\\n\\tpressing the 7/8 and 9/10 buttons together!  Neat!  And\\n\\tyou can never lock yourself out of the car.\\n\\n    I really feel like I don\\'t deserve this car.  I really can\\'t\\n\\tbelieve that I could afford it.  I got this car ten years \\n\\tahead of schedule.  :-)\\n\\n    I love this car so much that I\\'ve been telling my parents to\\n\\tlook into buying one.  I love this car so much that I\\n\\twrote this 13K file -- I meant to write a couple of lines\\n\\tand ended up with this.  \\n\\n    If there were a J.D. Powers Survey for used car owners, I would have\\n\\tan opportunity to express my incredible satisfaction of owning this \\n\\tcar.  I don\\'t like thinking about getting another car, but at this\\n\\tpoint in time, I\\'m sure I\\'d buy another SHO.  For under $7000, you\\n\\tcan\\'t beat it.  (Next time with an airbag and ABS, though.)\\n\\n    Insurance-wise, this car is also a big win.  I pay the same premiums\\n\\tas on my 1987 Toyota Celica -- despite that it has nearly twice\\n\\tthe horsepower.  \\n\\n\\n\\nOther Odds and Ends:\\n\\n    Much to my amazement, there is no SHO mailing list anywhere.\\nMaybe because the _SHO Registry_ publication has filled this void.  I\\nhaven\\'t joined yet, but I\\'ve noticed that queries about SHOs still\\nappear on rec.autos about once a month.  Owners of SHOs are always\\nquick to respond, and are very vocal fans of the cars.  (Maybe some\\nof the most vocal on rec.autos.  :-)\\n\\n    I\\'ve put together the responses to my questions about the cars, as\\nwell as other posts with useful information on these cars.  I\\'ll be \\nposting this in the form of a FAQ soon.  \\n\\n    If anyone is interested in starting a mailing list, please speak up!\\nI don\\'t know if I have the resources here at Purdue to start one, but \\nmaybe someone out there does.\\n',\n",

       " '\\nWhile I don\\'t read normally read this group, I was looking for Valentine radar\\ninformation (sigh, maybe in the FAQ) and came across your posting..\\n\\nI bought a \\'93 Probe GT with the PEP 263A last July (now at 9500 miles)\\nafter debating over the Sentra SE-R/NX2000, MX6, MR-2, Stealth, Prelude, \\nand Celica.\\n\\nCheck this month\\'s Consumer Reports for previous Probe records.  \\n\\nMy criteria: a \"fun\" car with ABS, airbag, over 130hp, and less than $25K.\\nI thought about a turbo, but checking with insurance people ruled that out.\\nThe Tri-Star cars (Eclipse/Talon/etc) were out since they don\\'t have an air bag.\\nDitto for the Mustang(also no ABS).\\nThe SE-R/NX2000/M20 fell into the pocket-rocket category.  A good used car buy.\\nThe MX-6 was almost there but rolled more than I liked.  \\nI didn\\'t like the Prelude dash/instrumentation at all.  Too weird for me.\\nThe MR2 has a much smaller non-passenger space than I needed, so out that went.\\nThe Celica was \"ok\" but underpowered when loaded with options (and somewhat\\noverpriced too) in non-turbo form.\\nI never considered the 240SX since it didn\\'t have an airbag.  I did look at it\\nfor its RWD virtues but that\\'s it.  The Corolla never entered my mind.\\nI should have looked at the Mitsubishi VR4/Dodge Stealth more.\\nSince my list was exhausted, I bought the Probe.  :-)\\n\\nThe car design is different than earlier years, so it\\'s too early to see its\\nreliability so far.  For what it\\'s worth, my comments:\\n\\nMy dislikes:\\nShutting door with windows up from inside rarely makes good wind seal.\\nHeadlights have \"stuck\" up a few times (weather?)\\nair conditioning broke ~4000 miles (pressure cycling switch)\\ncondensation around rear washer fluid container doesn\\'t drain completely.\\ncrammed engine; little hope for do-it-yourselfers (typical)\\nparts somewhat more expensive than normal Ford parts\\nunderside plastic doesn\\'t like sharp driveways and speedbumps (typical).\\nassembly gripes: tape on radiator, screw fell out of dash, seat seams not \\nstitched properly.  Hopefully just a fluke.\\nFord only gives 1 key with the car.  C\\'mon Ford, spend an extra few pennies!\\nRear hatch has no padding on corners when up.  I\\'m waiting for the day when\\nI bash my head on the corner.\\nhorn buttons behind air bag in spokes and not in center (personal preference)\\nTires fling dirt/mud onto side of car \\n\\nMy Likes:\\nengine (design/valves/sounds/smoothness/power/mileage/torque) -- definitely #1\\nhandling (very good for FWD; understeer only at limits)\\ntransmission (the 5 speed is a must)\\nusable instrumentation (lovely readable analog everywhere)\\nVery little torque steer at full power (much better than the \\'90 SHO I drive)\\nstability at 100+mph (high gearing though)\\nlow cowl (good visibility in front)\\nHeated outside mirrors (nice in fog, never tested in freezing weather)\\nABS/Air bag (see above)\\nrear seats fold down (I have few rear seat passengers so a trunk not important)\\nNo shake/rattle noises when going over bumps/potholes (still!)\\nTires: 225/55VR16 Goodyear Eagles (70% left; hoping for 30K :-)\\n\\nAs you can see, I\\'m primarily interested in the engine.  While it doesn\\'t\\nhave the uummmph of a big-liter car or the turbo rush, the big selling\\npoint for me was the all-aluminum 24 value 2.5 liter engine.  \\n\\nThe overall car is a good buy for the money.  That market segment hasn\\'t changed\\nmuch since July (Prelude VTEC, Honda Del Sol??).  I drive it to and from work\\neach day on relatively smooth roads, and most noticable thing is that the\\nProbe\\'s suspension doesn\\'t like potholes.  When you test drive one, find a \\npotholed road somewhere around town and see if the jarring you get is tolerable.\\nIf you have 3+ passengers, by all means bring them along too.  They\\'ll find\\nthat they have no room in the back and you\\'ll find that the car rides\\ndifferently (if that\\'s \"better\" is up to you).  Also, there\\'s a lot of glass\\naround you which I wasn\\'t expecting; the temperature inside the car gets pretty\\nhot in the summer.  My back seat passengers (now very few) complain about\\nthe lack of ventilation; you may want to consider that when combined with\\nthe heat.  I\\'ve heard that the exhaust system has trouble, but mine works fine.\\nLeather and the keyless entry system weren\\'t available when I got the car so\\nI can\\'t comment on them (I got the car before it was officially announced).  \\nI prefer cloth to leather anyway.  \\n\\nI wouldn\\'t want this car in the snow:  The suspension is too rough for the\\ninevitable surprise potholes, tires aren\\'t meant for snow, and the seats assume\\nthat you\\'re not wearing lots of thick clothing.  Rain is much better:  water \\ngenerally beads off the windshield at freeway speed, the windshield wiper\\ncontrols are easy and understandable, and I barely hydroplaned once with the\\nEagles (and I was really trying).  \\nThere is also a definite lack of cup holder/small storage places.  The GT\\nhas map holders below the speakers in the door, but they\\'re rigid plastic\\nthat could fit two cassettes or CD\\'s max.  The center console/storage bin/arm\\nrest has *1* cup holder and the back of the front seats have a cloth \"pouch\"\\nbut that\\'s it.  No change holders.  Quite a let-down from the SHO.\\nAnd the Probe is definitely not a people-mover car or an econo-box car!\\n\\nLastly, don\\'t store wet car covers in the back.  The foam will soak the \\nwater up and the result will *not* smell pleasant :-(.\\n\\nNathan\\nnathan@sco.com\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Thanks to eck@panix.com (Mark Eckenwiler) and\\nthf2@kimbark.uchicago.edu (Ted Frank), my account is to be axed.\\nI guess that the information I am presenting is just toooo difficult\\nfor them to deal with. They (ONLY Ted and Mark) have complained to my\\nsysadmin some unknown number of times to get me off the net. (In his\\ndefense, Mark sent only one message and it was not THAT bad; it has\\nbeen posted in one of the newsgroups; However, it *was* not directed\\nat me as would be common practice and I am VERY good at responding\\nvia netmail...)\\n\\nWhile I disagree with Ted, I would not send mail to his sysadmin\\nto get him axed. Name-calling was not enough; jumping on every post\\nI made was not enough; ignoring specific points when they were not\\nwhat the desired picture was not enough; SIMPLY IGNORING ME IF I\\nAM SUCH A KOOK WAS NOT ENOUGH. Even now I do not wish to have him\\naxed, but I do wish to express my disgust about this. \"Argumentum\\nad silence-your-opponent-um\"?! I would have thought he would have\\nwanted me to stay around just to have someone to yell about and\\nseem sooo wise... (to himself, I think).\\n\\nThe issue that seems to be: \"Is the following an advertisement?\"\\nApparently, Ted and Mark think so...\\n\\n1) I Posted an article from around one year ago as it was taken \\n\\t*off the net* from last year. If reposting an article\\n\\tconstitutes posting an ad, then I am guilty. This post\\n\\tdid have a name and address and, yes, a price. If one\\n\\thad posted the address and subscription price of \"Newsweek\",\\n\\twould that be an ad? I get nothing from showing this stuff.\\n2) I Posted a list of documents showing examples of the kind of\\n\\t\"proof\" that was REQUESTED BY TED FRANK. He then complains\\n\\tto my sysadmin saying that I am advertising and, lo and\\n\\tbehold, \"poof\", there goes my account. This one had an\\n\\taddress in it! Oh, no! I Guess that means it is an ad!\\n\\nIf you value the alternative view I have been discussing, or VALUE\\nITS DISCUSSION even if you do not agree with it, I ask that you send\\na note saying as much to me to show to the sysadmin. They rarely get\\n\"Ya know, that user on your net was real helpful...\" or whatever; they\\nonly get \"I don\\'t like what that user is doing because...\".\\nPlease do not send the note to the sysadmin. I need to take it to them\\nin a manner that has at least a chance of getting through.\\n\\nIn my files here are hundreds of responses from people saying \"Thanks for\\nthe info\" or \"Could you send me such and such?\" or \"Your posts are\\nvery interesting... keep it up.\" and only a handfull of \"Go aways\". But,\\nI guess the fact that I have decided not to waste my time trying to\\nconvince Ted is a Net Offense[TM] of such magnitude as to warrant\\na message complaining about me. (Knock, knock...\"My name is Ted and\\nand this is Mark... We\\'re from the thought police. Seems you have\\nsome pretty dangerous ideas here, and we\\'re here to confiscate them...\")\\nNWO Indeed!\\n\\nGuess I will have to go back to the drawing board and come up with\\na new plan...

I ask what this has accomplished... Is there some benefit\\nfrom making alternative views simply vanish? Not in my book. \\nSeems the easiest way to win an argument is to make the opposing side\\nshut up. Images of Waco.... ah, but alas... And all this when I am in the\\nprocess of typing in a letter to me from the Tax Collector saying that\\na lien was removed due to a letter that I wrote challenging jurisdiction.\\nOh, well... It takes time to come up with the info requested, and I\\nwas just getting started.\\n\\nIt should be noted that Ted Frank has been accused publicly over 40\\ntimes of being an NWO supporter and has never made an statements to the\\ncontrary. Further, what ARE Ted Frank\\'s motivations for getting me axed?\\nWe all know that SOME PEOPLE are getting paid to collect info on people\\non the net that are of \"interest\" to the government, and Ted sure seems\\nto have a *personal* interest in debunking me. Hmmm... just who does\\nhe work for?

[1]\\n\\nBorn 1964\\nSecretary-Typist\\nAzsantekmontazh Trust\\nSumgait Construction and Installation Administration\\nSecretary of the SMU Komsomol Organization\\n\\nResident at Building 17/33B, Apartment 15\\nMicrodistrict No. 3\\nSumgait [Azerbaijan]\\n\\n\\nOn the 27th my sister Marina and I went to the movies the seven o\\'clock show,\\nat the theater that is across from the City Party Committee, about 50 yards \\naway. The SK theater. They were showing an Argentinian film, \"The Abyss.\" \\nBefore the film we noticed about 60 to 70 people standing near the podium at \\nthe City Party Committee, but they were silent, there\\'s no conversation \\nwhatsoever, and we couldn\\'t figure out what was going on. That is, we knew it \\nwas about Karabagh, but what it was exactly, what they were talking about, if \\nsomeone gave a speech or not, we didn\\'t know. We bought our tickets. There \\nwere 30 or 40 people in the theater. This was a very small number for that \\nlarge movie theater. The film started. About 30 minutes later they stopped the\\nfilm. A crowd burst in. About 60 people. They came up onto the stage. Well \\nmostly they were young people, from 16 to 23 years old. They demanded that an \\nArmenian woman come up onto the stage. They used foul language and said that \\nthey were going to show what Azerbaijanis were capable of, what they could do \\nto Armenian girls. I thought that\\'s what they meant because they had demanded \\na girl specifically. Marina and I were sitting together. I told her to move \\nover, there were some Russian girls sitting nearby. So that if someone \\nrecognized me or if something happened, they would take me, and not Marina. \\nIt got quiet, 2 or 3 girls jumped up to run out, but the door was closed--it\\'s\\nonly opened at the end of the   show--and they returned to their seats. \\nEveryone in the theater was looking at one another, Russians, Azerbaijanis, \\npeople of various nationalities. But no one reacted at all, no one in the \\nauditorium made a sound. They were silent, looking at one another, and \\ngradually started to leave. Some guy, a really fat one, says, \"OK, we\\'ve \\nscared them enough, let\\'s leave.\" They leave slowly, pompously. It seemed to \\nme that those people were not themselves. Either they had smoked a bunch of \\n\"anasha\", or had taken something else, because they all looked beastly, like \\nthey were ready to tear anyone apart. Then it was all over, as though nothing \\nhad happened at all. The film started up again, it was one of those cheerful \\nfilms which should have only brought pleasure, made you happy to be alive. We \\ncould barely sit to the end. So it had started at seven it was over by nine, \\nand it was dark . . .\\n\\nMarina and I were walking home, Lenin Street, that\\'s the center of town. Lenin\\nStreet was packed, just packed with young people. They were shouting, \\nsomething about Karabagh and something about Armenians. We weren\\'t especially \\nlistening, because the way we were feeling we didn\\'t know if we were going to \\nmake it home or not, and just what had happened anyway? Public transportation \\nwasn\\'t running. Incidentally, when we came out of the theater we saw police, \\npolicemen standing there. The director of the movie theater was looking at the\\ndoors, because when they were leaving they had broken the glass, the doors \\nthere are basically all glass. Everything was broken. He stood there grief-\\nstricken, but looking as though nothing really big had happened, like some \\nnaughty boys had just broken them quite by accident, with a slingshot. Well, \\nsince he looked more or less calm I decided that, nothing all that super \\nserious had happened. We went out very slowly; we wanted to catch a bus, we \\nlive literally one stop away. We didn\\'t want to go on foot, not because it was\\ndark, but because something might happen. We flagged down a cab, but the \\ndriver didn\\'t want to take us. We told him we live near the bus station, and \\nhe said he\\'d take us to the bus station and not a yard farther. I said, well, \\nOK . . .\\n\\nSo we got into the cab and managed to get there. Something incredible was \\nhappening at the bus station. There was a traffic jam. Public transportation \\nwas at a standstill and everyone was shouting \"Ka-ra-bagh,\" they\\'re not going \\nto give up Karabagh. I go home and tell my family what\\'s going on, and there\\'s\\nimmediate panic in the house. Mamma says, what should we do? Like the end had \\ncome, they were going to come, kill us, that\\'s it . . . Somehow we managed to \\ncheer ourselves up: Nothing that bad could happen. Where are we living anyway,\\njust what kind of social order do we have? Somehow we manage to calm Mamma \\ndown. And we went to bed. But no one could sleep. Everyone made as though \\nnothing had happened.\\n\\nThat was on Saturday. In short, the day went by. We didn\\'t go anywhere and \\ndidn\\'t call our relatives. No one did anything. Because . . . life goes on.\\nThat day I realized something was approaching, but what exactly, I couldn\\'t\\nguess.\\n\\nOn the 28th everything was like it was supposed to be, we lived like we always\\nhad. There were five of us at home: Mamma, Papa and us, three sisters: Lyuda, \\nMarina, and I. My sister Lyuda was in Yerevan at the time. We sat at home and \\nno one went out. Later we learned that a demonstration had started that \\nmorning. It all started . . . They were smashing up stores. We were sitting at\\nhome and didn\\'t know anything about it. Then a girlfriend of mine, Lyuda \\nZimogliad, came by at around three o\\'clock I think. We worked together, we did\\nour apprenticeships together, she\\'s a Russian girl. She said that something\\nawful was happening in town. I asked, \"Don\\'t they want Armenians? Well what \\nare they after, if they\\'re already in that state?\" She says, no, nothing like \\nthat, it\\'s just a demonstration, but it\\'s awful to watch it. Somehow, it feels\\nlike a war has broken out. Public transportation has been stopped . . . The \\ncabs, the buses, well it\\'s just a nightmare.\\n\\nThen Papa decides to go to the drugstore, my mother was having allergy \\nproblems at the time . . . He left the house and our neighbor, Aunt Vera,\\nasked him, \"Where are you going? Stop! There are such terrible things going\\non in the courtyard; aren\\'t you afraid to go out?\" Papa didn\\'t know what she\\nwas talking about. She simply pushed him back into the entryway. He came home \\nand told Mamma. Mamma said, \"Well, if Aunt Vera was talking like that it means\\nthat something is really going on.\" But we didn\\'t go see her, she\\'s a Russian,\\nshe lives across from us. I had to see my friend out. Around five o\\'clock I \\ntell Lyuda, \"Ok, look, it\\'s time for you to go, it\\'s late already, I\\'ll see \\nyou out.\" Mamma says, \"You don\\'t need to go, it\\'s too late already, you can \\nsee what the situation in town is.\" So we decided to stay home. Dinner was \\nready. Mamma says, \"Let her eat with us, then she can go.\" We sat down at the \\ntable. But no one was hungry, no one was in the mood, we just put everything \\nout on the table to calm ourselves down, and make it appear that we\\'re eating.\\nWe turned on the television, and the show \"In Fairy-Tale Land\" was coming on. \\nWe cleared the table.\\n\\nWe hear some noise out in the courtyard. I go out on the balcony, but I can\\'t \\nsee what\\'s going on, because the noise is coming from the direction of the bus\\nstation, and there is a 9-story building in the way. There is mob of people \\n. . . I can\\'t figure out what\\'s happening. They\\'re shouting something, looking\\nsomewhere, I can\\'t make out what is going on. I go down to a neighbor, she\\'s \\nan Azerbaijani; we\\'ve been friends of her family for about 25 years. I go down\\nto look from their place. I see people shouting, looking at the 5-and 9-story \\nbuildings near the bus station. Just then soldiers set upon them, about 20 \\npeople, with clubs. The mob runs off in different directions. I even see \\nseveral people from our building. They are looking and laughing . . . I decide\\nthat means it\\'s not all that bad if they are laughing: it means they\\'re not \\nkilling anyone. But now the crowd suddenly dashes toward the soldiers. One of \\nthe soldiers cannot manage to get away, they start stomping on him with their \\nfeet, everyone\\'s kicking him . . . I become ill and go home, and explain in \\ngeneral terms that horrible things are going on out there . . .  can\\'t speak\\n. . . Well, they\\'ve probably killed that soldier, the way that crowd is . . .\\nIf each of them kicked him just once . . . They took his club away from him\\nand started to beat him with it. But it was far away and I couldn\\'t see if he\\ngot up and left or not.\\n\\nI become terrified and go home and say, \"Lyuda, don\\'t go anywhere, stay at our\\nplace, because if you go out they could kill you or . . . \" Then the crowd \\nruns over closer toward our building and stands at the 12-story building and \\nstarts shouting something. We go out onto the balcony. All of our neighbors \\nare also out on theirs, too. Everyone is standing, staring. The mob is \\nshouting and about 5 minutes later comes running toward our building. As it \\nturns out, at the 12-story building the Azerbaijani neighbors went down and \\nkept them from coming in. There\\'s only one entryway there, they could stop \\nthem.\\n\\nThey all run up to our building. Mamma immediately starts closing the windows,\\nafraid that they might throw stones. They have stones and they break the \\nwindows, all of them. There are very many people. We have a large courtyard, \\nand it\\'s packed with people. They spill up to the first floor so they don\\'t \\ncrush each other. They crawl up on trees, posts, and garages. It\\'s just a huge\\ncloud of people. They break and burn the motorcycle of the Armenian Sergey \\nSargisian, from our building. We close the windows and immediately hear \\ntramping in our entryway. They come up to our fifth floor with a tremendous \\ndin and roar. It\\'s incomprehensible. Mamma told me later that they were \\nshouting Father\\'s name, \"Grisha, open the door, we\\'ve come to kill you!,\" or\\nsomething like that. I don\\'t remember that, I was spaced out, kind of. Mamma \\nsays, \"Into the bedroom, quickly!\" In the bedroom we have two tall beds, part \\nof our dowry; Mamma says, \"Hide there, they probably won\\'t come in there, \\nthey\\'ll ask something, say something, and leave.\" She says, \"We\\'ll tell them \\nthat we live alone here.\" I can\\'t imagine that my parents will stand out in \\nthe hall alone talking with some sort of beasts . . . I go to them and say \\nthat I\\'ll stand together with them, I\\'ll talk with them if they come, maybe I \\ncan find a common language with them, all the more so if they know me: I speak \\nAzerbaijani more or less, and I can find out what they want. I told Marina and\\nLyuda to hide under the bed, and my sister Lyuda, I can\\'t remember if I told \\nher anything or not.\\n\\nThen . . . they open the door: it\\'s like they blew on it and it broke and fell\\nright into the hall. The crows bursts in and starts to shout: Get out of here,\\nleave, vacate the apartment and go back to your Armenia; things like that. I\\ntell them, \"What has happened, speak calmly. One of you, tell me, calmly, what\\nhas happened.\" In Azerbaijani, they say, \"Get out of the apartment, leave.\" I \\nsay, \"OK. Go downstairs. We\\'ll gather everything we need and leave the \\napartment.\" I realize that it is senseless to discuss any sort of rights with\\nthem, these are animals. They must be stopped. The ones standing in the\\ndoorway, the young guys, say, \"There are old people and one girl with them.\\nToo bad!\" They take two or three steps back. It seems as though I have\\npacified them with our exchange. Then someone in the courtyard shouts, \\ncommanding them: \"Don\\'t you understand what you are saying? Kill them?\"\\n\\nAnd that was it! That was all it took. They grab Papa, carry him into one\\nroom, and Mamma and me into another. They put Mamma on the bed and start \\nundressing her, beating her legs. They start tearing my clothes, right there, \\nin front of Mamma. I don\\'t remember where they went, what they did, or how \\nmuch time passed. I had the feeling that they beat me on the head, on my body,\\nand tore my clothes, all at the same time, I don\\'t even know what I said. The \\natrocities started. I was savagely raped in that room. They argued among \\nthemselves who would go first.\\n\\nLater, I remember, I came to. I don\\'t know if I\\'m dead or alive. Someone comes\\nin, someone tall, I think, clean-shaven, in an Eskimo dogskin coat, balding. \\nHe looks around at what\\'s happening. At that instant everything stops. It \\nseems to me that he is either their commander or . . . that somehow everything\\ndepends on him. He looks and says, \"Well, we\\'re done here.\" They are beating\\nMamma on the head. They break up the chairs and beat her with the chair legs \\n. . . She loses consciousness, and they decide that she\\'s dead. Papa . . . was\\nout cold. They want to throw Lyuda off the balcony, but they can\\'t get the \\nwindow open. Apparently the window frames are stuck after the rain and the \\nwindows can\\'t be opened. They leave her next to the window. She was thinking \\nabout being thrown out the window and passed out. She\\'s not a real strong \\nperson anyway . . . He looks at me and sees that I\\'m saying something, that\\nI\\'m still twitching. Well, I start saying the opposite of what I should be, \\nwhich is humbling myself and pleading. I start shouting, cursing . . . they \\ndon\\'t get any entreaty out of me. I  already know that I\\'m dead, why would I \\nhumble myself before anyone? And he says that if that\\'s what I think, since my\\ntongue is so long . . . maybe he thinks that I still look quite appealing \\n. . . In short, he commands that I be taken outside.\\n\\nI no longer saw or remembered what was happening to Marina and Lyuda, I don\\'t \\nknow if they are alive or not. They take me outside. They are dragging me by \\nmy arms, by my legs. They are hitting me against the wall, the railings, \\nsomething metal . . . While they are carrying me someone is biting me, someone\\nelse is pinching me . . .I don\\'t even know. I think, my God, when will death \\ncome? If only it were sooner . . . Then . . . they carry me out, throw me near\\nthe entryway . . . and start kicking me. I lose consciousness . . . What \\nhappened after that, how many people there were, I don\\'t remember.\\n \\nI come to after a while, I don\\'t remember how long. A neighbor is bringing me \\nclothing. I\\'m entirely covered with blood, she puts a dress on me. I remember \\nthat I said the same words over and over again: \"Mamma, what happened, Mamma, \\nwhat have they done to us, where are we, whose house are we at?\" I can\\'t make \\nsense out of anything. There is a guy standing over me, I sort of know him, he\\nserved in Afghanistan, his name is Igor, he brought me indoors. When they all \\nwent to the third entryway and killed a person there, Igor gathered his \\ncourage, took me into his arms, and brought me to the neighbors\\', even though \\nhe\\'s small-minded, he put himself at risk. Igor Agayev is Azerbaijani; he \\nserved in Afghanistan. There are three brothers. The older brother also served\\nthere, I think; now he\\'s stationed here, on the border, in Armenia. Igor \\nbrought me to the neighbors\\', and then helped me come to my senses, saying, \\n\"Karina, I know you, calm down, I\\'m not one of them.\" How do I know who\\'s who \\nand what\\'s what? I come to, and they clean me up. I was covered in blood. Then\\nPapa . . . I saw Papa, I saw Mamma. And Marina, too . . . Igor was there when \\nthey dragged Marina and Lyuda out from under the bed . . . Marina . . . Lyuda \\nsaid that she was Russian, they said, we\\'ll let you go, we aren\\'t touching the\\nRussians, go. And while they are dragging Marina out she decides she\\'s going \\nto tell them she\\'s Azerbaijani. Igor immediately grabs Marina\\'s and Lyuda\\'s \\nhands, because he knows Marina, and knows that she is Armenian and is our \\nsister, and takes her to the second floor to a neighbor\\'s and starts pounding \\non the door so she will open up. She opens the door and Igor pushes them in \\nthere. So they survived.\\n\\nMy sister Lyuda lost consciousness after the bandits started stealing things.\\nWhile they were going downstairs, taking things downstairs, then coming back \\nup again, Lyuda seized the opportunity and crawled under the bed and stayed \\nthere. Then, when she was herself again, she found a torn night shirt and put \\nit on, and some sort of robe and went to a neighbor\\'s on the fourth floor, the\\none whose apartment I had watched the crowd from, the friend of ours, and \\nknocked on the door. The neighbor opened and said, \"I\\'m not going to let you \\nin the apartment because I\\'m afraid of them. But I\\'ll give you some stockings \\nand we\\'ll leave the building.\" Lyuda says, \"I\\'ll stay at your place because of\\nwhat\\'s going on, they keep going up and down the stairs.\" It was just for a \\nmoment, just a moment in life, but the neighbor wouldn\\'t consent. Lyuda came \\nback to our place and lay under the bed . . .\\n\\nI came to. Mother was there. I can\\'t remember my supervisor\\'s telephone \\nnumber, but something had to be done. Somehow I remembered and called, and he \\ncame to get us. He didn\\'t have any idea what was going on. He thought we were \\nsimply afraid, he didn\\'t know that they were killing us and that we had passed\\nbetween life and death. He came and got us and took us to the police precinct.\\nThere they looked us over. I was having trouble walking, my lungs hurt badly, \\nit was hard to breathe . . .\\n\\nMy supervisor\\'s name is Urshan Feyruzovich Mamedov. He\\'s the head of our \\nadministration. They took us there. When we were leaving, I saw a great number\\nof buses full of soldiers at the entrance to town. The buses were ordinary \\npassenger buses. There were very many soldiers. We left around eleven, right \\nafter eleven. If these people could stop what was happening they could save a \\ngreat many lives . . . Because the crowd was moving on, toward the school, and\\nwhat was going on there . . . I think everyone know not only in Sumgait, not \\nonly in Yerevan. Because there they murdered them all one after the next, \\nwithout stopping. After us.\\n\\nI think 14 people died in Microdistrict No. 3, and 10 to 12 of them were from\\nBuildings 4, 5, and 6. In our building one person died, and one old woman died\\nfrom Building 16, that\\'s the building in front of ours. There young \\nAzerbaijani men stopped the mob and wouldn\\'t let it into their building. \\nIncidentally, when we were at the neighbors\\', Marina called our relatives\\nto warn them, so they would all know what was happening. I called a aunt in \\nMicrodistrict No. 5. They have three neighbors who are Armenians. I said, \"Run\\nquickly, I can\\'t explain what\\'s going on; hide, do what you can, just stay\\nalive. Hide at Azerbaijanis\\', ones who won\\'t give you away.\" At that moment \\nthree people came in, policemen. I think they were Azerbaijanis. I was in such\\nawful condition, my face was completely distorted my lips were puffed up, \\nthere was blood, my eye was swollen, no one thought I would ever see anything \\nout of that eye again . . . my forehead was badly cut, and one-half of my face\\nwas pushed out forward. No one would have thought that I would survive, get my\\nnormal appearance back, and be able to grasp anything at all. I started to \\nscream at those people, why did you come, who sent you here, no one wants you \\nhere, haven\\'t you killed people people yet, what are you doing here? One of \\nthe soldiers said, \"Don\\'t scream at us. We\\'re Muslims, but we\\'re not from the \\nSumgait police. They called in from Daghestan.\" So at that point the \\nDaghestan police were there.\\n\\nWhen we got to the police precinct there were an awful lot of police there,\\nthere were soldiers, police with dogs, ambulances, firemen . . . I don\\'t know,\\nmaybe they were waiting for people to bring them the goners and the seriously \\ninjured to treat them there in the police precinct. I don\\'t know what they \\nwere there for. There were also doctors from Baku there. They examined Lyuda \\nand me and said, \"These women need to go to the Maternity Home, but we don\\'t \\nknow what to do with the rest.\"\\n\\nSo they took us, and I lost contact with my parents, my boss, everyone. My \\nboss said, \"Don\\'t worry, I\\'ll find you, no matter where you are, no matter\\nwhat happens.\" We went to the hospital. There we were examined by a department\\nhead from the Sumgait Maternity Home, Pashayeva, I think her name was. She \\nexamined us. The ambulance was from Baku; I figured out that the Sumgait \\nambulances hadn\\'t done anything, they didn\\'t respond to any calls. People \\ncalled and neither the police nor the ambulances showed any sign of life.\\n\\nThat doctor looked me over and I could tell from her behavior that something\\nvery good had happened, for she became quite glad. I even thought to myself, \\n\"God, can it be that nothing all that bad is wrong?\" She looks me over and \\nsays, \"Now why are you suffering so? You don\\'t know what your people have been\\ndoing, your people did even worse things.\" And I think, great, I have to deal \\nwith her . . . And I felt so bad, I thought, why don\\'t I just die so as not to\\nhave to hear more stuff like this from people like her? Here I am in this \\ncondition and being told about something that our people did. I just didn\\'t \\nhave the energy to say, \"How could our people possibly be smart enough to \\nthink of something that yours haven\\'t already done?\" I stayed there. Then they\\nbrought in another woman, Ira B., she was married, and she was raped in her \\nown apartment, too. There were three of us, Ira, Lyuda, and 1. The next \\nmorning they took Lyuda and Ira away. They didn\\'t do anything to help us. This\\nwas in the old Maternity Home, in the combined block. They didn\\'t do anything \\nmore than examine me, that was it. I didn\\'t want any shots or tranquilizer, \\nnothing. What shots could have calmed me down? I didn\\'t even want to look at \\nthem.\\n\\nI lay in the ward. Either it just worked out that way or they did it on pur-\\npose, but I was alone. I was alone even though the wards were packed. That\\nsame evening a woman came by and asked me what was wrong with me, that my face\\nwas disfigured. She asked what had happened to me, and I said, \"Better to ask \\nyour brother what happened, there\\'s no point in asking me, your brother can \\nbetter explain what happened.\" She fell into a faint. All the doctors threw \\nthemselves at her, and the doctor categorically forbade anyone to come into my\\nward.\\n\\nThen people from work came to see me, my boss, his daughter; they brought me \\nclothing, because I was literally naked. The only thing I had on was a dress, \\nbut the woman who gave it to me was very short, and the dress was way up \\nabove my knees, and the woman orderly said, \"I can\\'t believe you put on such a\\nshort dress, who are you showing off your legs to here?\" I went back to my \\nward thinking, just one more thing from something. People from work came and \\nbrought me something in a sack, apples, I think, three or four pounds, but I \\ncouldn\\'t take them. I had become so weak that it was just embarrassing. I said\\nthat I couldn\\'t take the apples, and really didn\\'t have any appetite. No one \\nhad to bring me anything. Some woman took the sack . . . And, oh yes! . . . \\nThen I heard that the head doctor tell a nurse that my medical history should \\nbe hidden or torn up completely so that no one would know that I was an \\nArmenian, maybe they wouldn\\'t figure it out from looking at me. So they must \\nhave been thinking that there would be some kind of attack, that something \\nelse would happen. That it would be worse. Or, perhaps, someone was outside on\\nthe street, I don\\'t know. In any case, I didn\\'t sleep a wink that night.\\n\\nThe next morning they picked me up, a whole police detail, put me in a bus, \\nand off we went. I didn\\'t even know where they were taking me. They took me to\\nthe club where the troops were, the very one I was in that ill-fated evening.\\nI got off the bus. Near the City Party Committee there were a great many \\ntroops, tanks, armored personnel carriers; the whole scene was terrible. I saw \\na few people I knew there, and that calmed me a little. I had already thought \\nthat I was the only one left. So there were five or six of us left in Sumgait \\nafter that night. I still didn\\'t know what happened to my parents, they didn\\'t \\ncome to see me in the hospital, and my boss told me that everything was fine. \\nI didn\\'t know whether to believe him or not. Maybe he was just trying to calm \\nme down, maybe something happened on the way. Then I went to the club and saw \\na lot of people I knew. They all knew one another, they were all kissing each \\nother and asking, \"What happened, what went on?\" Two days later they came to \\nsee me from work. They were there all the time. Each day they came, showed \\ninterest, and were constantly bringing me money. They did everything they \\ncould. Of course I\\'m most thankful to my boss, the only one of my colleagues \\nwho didn\\'t lose his presence of mind and who didn\\'t change his opinions, \\nneither before, nor after, nor in the heat of the moment, no matter what \\nhappened. He constantly took an interest. A sincere interest, from the heart \\n. . . Then, about two days later, the secretary of the Party Committee came, \\nnot from our Party organization, but from the First Trust, which ours is part \\nof, Comrade Kerimov, a very important figure in our town. He made arrangements\\nwith the emergency medical personnel to take me away, because if I sat down by\\nmyself I couldn\\'t get up or lie down again. There was something wrong with my\\nlungs, it was hard to breathe. They examined me there several times, there I \\nlay were several doctors, they all thought that . . . that it must just be \\nfrom all the blows, I don\\'t know. They didn\\'t diagnose anything in particular.\\nWhen I was in the Maternity Home I even asked . . . I made it a point of \\ninsisting that they take me to the trauma section because I felt so awful. \\nThere was no way something inside wasn\\'t broken, my ribs . . . Well they took \\nme there and took x-rays and said that everything was fine. There were \\nemergency medical workers on duty in the club. The mother of one of Marina\\'s \\nfriends was there. She was the head doctor at the Sumgait Children\\'s Clinic. \\nThey had every kind of antifever agent in the world, which was exactly what I\\nneeded at that moment, I thought. I said that I was having great difficulty\\nbreathing, I couldn\\'t seem to get enough air, something was wrong with me.\\nThey put tight bandages around my chest and waist. Later I overheard some\\npeople saying that I had been cut all over. I think they just saw me being all\\nbandaged up and decided that my breasts and face had been cut . . . But I\\nwasn\\'t cut.\\n\\nThey took us to the Khimik boarding house. We lived there a long time. Soon \\nappeared representatives . . . They were agitating. At first people would not \\ntalk to them, and drove them off. One of the Armenian women shouted, \"We \\ndemand that Seidov come!\" The response was, \"It\\'s Seidov who sent us.\" Seidov \\nis the Chairman of the Azerbaijani Council of Ministers. The woman said, \\n\"We\\'ll only see Seidov\\'s daughter, have her come here, we\\'ll do the same \\nthings to her that they did to our daughters, and then we\\'ll deal with you \\nagitators.\" And so on. More of them said, \"Have Seidov himself come.\" This \\nwent on day in, day out. The agitators kept coming and coming, this drove us \\nout of our wits. Then people gradually started departing for Yerevan because \\nthey realized it was senseless to stay. Everything got on our nerves: The \\nsmell, the small children. There were children at the SK club, children who \\nhad literally just come out of the Maternity Home. What were they doing in a \\nclub that didn\\'t even have running water all the time? At first we had to pay \\nto eat there. They even overcharged us, as it turned out. On the second day \\nsomeone told us that they would bring us food for free. The children were ill.\\nEverything stank there. Well imagine about 3,000 people in a small movie \\ntheater with seating for no more than 500. You couldn\\'t sit or lie down, it \\nwas impossible to even move. The stench was awful. Even the smallest infants \\ntook ill overnight there. I heard that they were arriving seriously ill in \\nYerevan, the infants. They have to be washed, they have to be bathed, not to \\nmention that we, the adults, were ill and needed care. People were fainting \\nright and left. I just don\\'t know, everyone was crying, everyone . . . Only \\nthe young people, the men, somehow managed to keep it together. But the women \\nwere in a constant state of panic. It seemed to everyone that they would come \\nany minute and kill and stab. It seemed clear that we had been gathered \\ntogether purposely, like during the war, so that they could burn the movie \\ntheater and there wouldn\\'t be a single Armenian left. Then people went up to \\nthe attic. I didn\\'t see them, I only heard them, because I was lying down and \\ncouldn\\'t get up. I lay right on the stage, we had some room there. Apparently \\nthey caught two people with either oil or gas. I think they wanted to burn the\\ntheater. Maybe someone saw them, I didn\\'t. I was in no condition to open my \\neyes.\\n\\nEveryone was suspicious of everyone else. They would ask, \"Aren\\'t you an \\nAzerbaijani? I think I saw you somewhere, I think you\\'re an Azerbaijani.\" They\\nled out all the men and started letting them back in by checking their\\npassports, relatives might be covering for each other. Half of the people did\\nnot have any documents. There were people who had run out of their homes in \\nnothing but a pair of pants and slippers, or wearing just a shirt, not like\\nthey should have, with their IDs.\\n\\nSo on the 28th, on Sunday, I think, the police did nothing to help us. On\\nMonday everything resumed where it had left off on Block 41A. They didn\\'t \\nspare a soul there: not children, not pregnant women, nobody. They killed,\\nthey burned, they hacked with axes, just everything possible. They murdered \\nthe Melkumian family whom I knew, my mother worked with them. Their daughter-\\nin-law went to school with my older sister. They were brutally murdered. Only \\nthe two daughters-in-law survived. By a miracle one was able to save herself, \\nshe ran away, the neighbors wouldn\\'t take her in, so she ran about the \\nbuilding until she found refuge. She was pregnant and had two small children. \\nThis all continued on Monday in Block 41A, on the 29th, when the troops were \\nalready in the city.\\n\\nThey murdered people, they overturned automobiles, and they burned entire \\nfamilies. They say they didn\\'t even know for sure if the people were Armenians\\nor not. I heard that the Lezgins suffered, too. I\\'m not sure myself, I didn\\'t \\nsee any Lezgins who had been injured. They burned cars so it\\'s very difficult \\nnow to say exactly who died and who didn\\'t. It was very difficult to identify \\nthe corpses, or rather, what remained of the corpses after they were doused in\\ngasoline and burned . . . it\\'s all very hard to imagine, of course I heard \\nthat many people disappeared without a trace, from the BTZ plant two people, \\nincluding a woman who worked the night shift, Aunt Razmella, who also lived in\\nMicrodistrict 3.\\n\\nThey were stopping buses between Baku and Sumgait. In the evening people who \\nhad been visiting Baku were returning to Sumgait, and people from Baku were \\ngoing home from Sumgait, and there were students, too. They were simply \\nsavagely murdered. They were stopping the buses, the drivers immediately did \\nwhat they were told because there was just no other way to deal with that \\nhoard of brutally minded people. They stopped the buses, dragged the Armenians\\nout and killed them on the spot. I didn\\'t see it myself, but I heard that they\\nput them all in a pile so as to burn them. Later it was hard to discern from \\nthe corpses, well you can\\'t call them corpses, you had to figure out from the \\nashes who it was. l heard that two fellows saved two women, one a student, Ira\\nG., if I\\'m not mistaken. She was in the hospital a long time after that, and \\nshe still can\\'t figure out who saved her. She was also brutally raped and \\nbeaten and thrown onto a pile of corpses. The fellow pulled her out of that \\nwhole pile of corpses, put his coat on her, took her into his arms, and \\ncarried her to the city. I still can\\'t imagine how he managed to do that.\\n\\nI heard that from Engels Grigorian. He knows her, apparently. Well a lot of \\npeople went to that hospital anyway. She was in the hospital and singing a \\nsong in Armenian, and they wrote the words down, and, I think he still has \\nthat piece of paper, because he says that a lot of people now have that song, \\nthe one she sang in the hospital where she lay in such bad shape. They \\ncouldn\\'t find the guy who saved her. He left her in someone\\'s apartment and\\ncalled the ambulance, she was in such awful shape that, probably, like me,\\nshe couldn\\'t remember anyone\\'s face.\\n\\nI think that I knew one of the people who broke into our house, maybe I had \\ntalked with him once. But I received so many blows everything was just knocked\\nout of my head. I can\\'t remember to this day who he was. Then, it seems, I saw\\nthe Secretary of the Directorate\\'s Party organization, where Marina works. She\\ngoes to school and works, she goes to night school at AZI, and works by day at\\nthe Khimzashchita Construction and Installation Administration. I\\'m the \\nSecretary of the Komsomol organization at our administration and often met \\nwith the secretaries of Party and Komsomol organizations. We had joint \\nmeetings. I know them all, I\\'ve even talked with them, and he, I know, is from\\nArmenia. An Azerbaijani, but from Armenia. It became obvious that many of \\nthose people were Azerbaijanis born in Armenia.\\n\\nThey took me to various police stations, to the police precinct, and to the\\nProcuracy, because the USSR Procuracy got involved in the case, and I iden-\\ntified the photographs of people who I could more or less recognize. They\\nshowed me the people who were in our apartment, they\\'re working on our\\ncase, but I can\\'t even recognize them, although it was proved that they were\\nthe ones, they\\'re processing it somehow. They tell me that they know that\\nsomeone held me by the arm and someone else held me by the leg when they were \\ndragging me. There was someone else in our apartment who did not even touch \\nme, he just stole a blanket and an earring or something like that. All these \\npeople, all of them, as much as I\\'ve heard about them and seen them, they were\\nall from Kafan.\\n\\nThe Secretary of the Party organization is named Najaf, Najaf Rzayev. He was \\nthere when everything started. It must have been him because I didn\\'t \\nrecognize anyone else in the crowd whom I knew besides him. All the more since\\nI told him, \"Listen, you do something, because you know me.\" He turned away \\nand went toward the bedroom, where Marina was. Well you couldn\\'t see Marina \\nanyway. There was such a noisy confusion of people that you couldn\\'t make out \\nanyone. All of it flew right out of my head, and then gradually I became \\nmyself again, at the City Party Committee . . . There were military people \\nthere. I told them what went on, and they wrote it all down. I told them his \\nname. On March 8 the Secretary of our First Trust Party organization, the one \\nwe\\'re part of, came to see us, his name is Najaf Rzayev. I tell Mamma, \"If\\nhe\\'s here despite the fact that I gave his name, it means that either his \\nalibi has been confirmed or, probably, that they think I\\'m crazy, not \\nresponsible for my words.\" He said, \"What did they do to you, how awful, \\nmyself, I hid an Armenian family.\" Then after some time goes by he comes back \\nagain and says something entirely different: \"I wasn\\'t at home, my family and \\nI went to Baku.\" I said, \"Marina, what is he saying? He said something totally\\ndifferent before.\" After that I didn\\'t go to see our Procurator, our case is \\nbeing handled by a procurator from Voronezh, Fedorov by name. Fedorov told me \\nthat Rzayev\\'s case had just gotten to him, and there were so names involved. \\nWhat are they doing with Rzayev?\\nDid he prove his alibi or not? They just think that since I was hit in the \\nhead I can\\'t say anything for sure, whether it was him or not. It will be an \\ninsult if he was in our apartment and doesn\\'t have to pay for it, but at the \\nsame time\\n\\nI\\'m afraid to say I\\'m a hundred percent sure that it was he. Because no mat-\\nter who I name, they tell me, no, you\\'re wrong, he didn\\'t do that, that one\\nwasn\\'t there. All the faces have gotten mixed up in my mind. Who did what\\nexactly I can\\'t say.                                                     \\n\\nWhen they took me outside there was a whole crowd there, but I didn\\'t see it, \\nbecause I had my eyes closed all the time. It seemed to me that I always got\\nit because of my eyes, people were always hassling me, for some reason it \\nalways seemed to me that my eyes are responsible. When they were beating my \\nface I thought they were trying to put my eyes out. So I had my eyes closed, \\nthey took me outside and started to beat me. A young guy, 22, held my arms, he\\nworks at the BTZ plant. And right nearby, across the road from us, Block 41, \\nis where all this was going on. Right across the road from us. The BTZ \\ndormitory is over there, that\\'s where he lives. Now he\\'s in custody, they even\\nhave proved, as far as I know, that it was he who killed Shurik Gambarian, the\\nclarinet player from the third entryway of our building. One person in our \\nbuilding was killed, it was that man.\\n\\nA guy comes by who shared a room with the guy who was holding me. He saw that\\nhe was holding me by the arms and that he was beating me, but he didn\\'t come \\nover, he just looked and then went into the dormitory. A while after it was \\nall over, people started making announcements in town saying that \\ninvestigators had been summoned. That guy went and told them everything. Now \\nthey\\'ve caught him, everything\\'s been proved. Now, evidently, they\\'ve been\\nbeating him, I don\\'t know what they\\'re doing with them over there, but he \\nhimself said that he was working the night shift at the plant. Some young guy \\ncame to the plant and said, \"Everyone who wants to kill Armenians come to the \\nbus station on Saturday at ten.\" That was it. He said, the ones who wanted to,\\nwent. This was at the BTZ plant, during the night shift, probably, late Friday\\nnight. It was at night, they were at the sauna together. And he said, what do \\nyou mean, do you understand what you are saying? The others were silent, \\nprobably, in their hearts they were thinking, I\\'m going to go. But they didn\\'t\\nsay anything to one another. He said that he thought it important to to go, \\nbecause he had heard a lot about what had happened in Kafan, that they had \\nkilled their Azerbaijani sisters, their mothers, burned villages, and all of \\nthat. That guy was also born in Kafan. That is certain. And Marina says that \\nthe Secretary of the Party organization is from Armenia, too.                                                             from\\n\\nI\\'ve participated in the investigation a couple of times. I\\'m satisfied with\\nthem thus far. They summoned us and asked about what happened, and every word \\nI said was recorded. I met some guy there . . . By the way, he was an \\nArmenian. I said that he was in our apartment, but what he did, I don\\'t know. \\nHis last name was Grigorian, Eduard Grigorian. He s from Sumgait, from \\nMicrodistrict 1. He was sentenced I think, to five years, not his first time. \\nHis mother is Russian. I met with him at the KGB in Baku, at the Azerbaijani \\nKGB. They took us there and showed me photographs. There were so many \\nphotographs, I think they even photographed those people who were caught at \\ncurfew, and I\\'ve got them all confused. I say, the face was about like this, \\nthe guy in the white coat with the red clasps. But he could take that coat off\\nand burn it somewhere, and it would be like looking for a needle in a \\nhaystack. Well. This guy, Grigorian, I said, he was in our apartment, but he \\nis so light-complected that he looks like a Lezgin. I don\\'t know what he did, \\nI can\\'t remember. Maybe he beat me or raped me. But he was in our apartment. \\nAt the KGB he started asking me, pleading with me, there\\'s no need for this, \\nall this stuff, look me in the eyes, you\\'re like a sister to me. I took a look\\nat him and thought, \"My God, Heaven forbid that I should have a brother like \\nyou.\" But they were satisfied with my responses, because I said everything \\nwithout great certainty. I was there with Mamma. Then Lyuda came in, but when \\nshe came in she got sick immediately. She wanted to kill him, she crawled over\\nthe table at him. She recognized him. When she came to, Lyuda was lying on the\\nbalcony, the mob threw her there and all of them ran into the bedroom. We had \\nall kinds of boxes with dishes in them, the dowries for all three sisters. \\nThey stole everything in the apartment, leaving only small things. At that \\nmoment Lyuda came to and started remembering everything. Well, seeing the \\nfaces, hearing the voices . . . Two people were saying they could burn the \\napartment. Another says, why burn the apartment when I\\'ve got three kids and \\nno place to live. So this guy was in temporary housing, he didn\\'t have \\nanywhere to live, he was from Sumgait. They were sure that they would get the \\napartment. Besides, the neighbors were Azerbaijani. Why should they burn the \\napartment, they might burn Azerbaijanis. That\\'s what they said. How did they \\nknow there were Azerbaijanis there, if they just picked a place, thinking that\\nArmenians lived there? We have a list of the residents for our part of the \\nbuilding, our name is in there, but how could they know that Azerbaijanis \\nlived on the other side of the wall from us? So they didn\\'t set fire to our \\napartment.\\n\\nI don\\'t know, I was in such bad shape that if all of it had come to a halt \\nwhen I was outside, if someone had asked me what was happening, I would\\nhave said that a civil war was going on. Well, maybe not civil . . . but\\nprobably civil, because when they were beating me I opened my eyes and saw\\nthat all the neighbors were standing on their balconies and watching, like at\\na free horror film. So a civil war was going on, and only the Armenians were\\nbeing fought. If it were a world war or something like that, they would have\\nbeen fighting everyone. But they only fought us. Then I met some women from \\nour building, some Azerbaijanis. They are crying, they tell me, \"Karina, we \\nsaw all of it, how could it happen?\" They\\'re asking me! Well I just don\\'t know\\nwhat to call it if a normal girl can stand there and watch what happened to \\nme. I think that if it were the other way around either I wouldn\\'t have been \\nable to take it, or I would have tried to avert it, like that one Azerbaijani \\nwoman did in front of our building. A woman lives there, an awful, dissipated \\nwoman, if you can call her a woman, the dissipated life she leads. Two \\nArmenian families live there, in her part of the building. She came out on the\\nbalcony and saw what was happening to me and started to scream and curse. She \\ncame down to the entryway and said, \"You\\'ll come in this entryway over my dead\\nbody.\" So not one of them took it in his head to go in that entryway. Some \\nfolks were saying that those people were so out of control that they didn\\'t \\neven know what they were doing. I don\\'t think that\\'s true. They knew very well\\nwhat they were doing if they didn\\'t even lift a hand against that woman. They \\ncouldn\\'t have cared less about her, but the fact that she was an Azerbaijani \\nstopped them.\\n\\nThey were just beasts, they had smoked so much. When they came to our place \\nthey were all chewing something. I noticed: Everyone who came into the \\napartment was chewing something. I think, my God, maybe I just think that? \\nMaybe I\\'m losing my mind? But no, they\\'re all chewing something. Maybe it is \\nsome kind of drug, it must be, because . . . At first glance they all seemed \\nto be such normal people, young, clean-shaven, looking exactly as if they had \\ncome to some sort of celebration. But they were shouting something. They\\ndidn\\'t talk, they shouted, as though there were deaf people there. They \\nscreamed and screamed: \"Yeah, killing, killing, we\\'re killing the Armenians!\" \\nOnly they didn\\'t shout \"kill,\" they shouted \"gurun ermianlary.\" Gurun \\nliterally means \"kill,\" or \"destroy.\"\\n\\nThat\\'s how it was! I\\'ll continue. We hid in a captain\\'s apartment, he\\'s an\\nAzerbaijani, his wife is a Tatar. We were sitting in their apartment, their \\nkids were out in the yard. Their kids knew a whole lot. This was in our part \\nof the building, on the third floor. When Mamma came to and couldn\\'t find\\nLyuda she took Papa\\'s hand, this was while the looters were stealing things,\\nbut they didn\\'t pay attention because they were stealing things. Apparently\\nthey had already ceased killing and switched to stealing. Mamma found the\\ncourage to . . .\\n\\nA boy said to my mother \"Where\\'s the gold?\" Mamma said he must have been 12 \\nto 14 years old. He even looked Russian, he was so fair-skinned. But the \\nAzerbaijanis from Armenia are fair-skinned. I noticed they were all on the \\nfair side. He shouted, they were all smashing things, and he asks Mamma where \\nthe gold is. We kept our gold in the wardrobe with our important papers. In a \\nlittle black bag, we kept everything in there. Mamma doesn\\'t really like to \\nwear gold. She probably never even wore those things from the time they were \\nbought for her. They took everything that was lying on the cheval glass. Mamma\\nthinks that the gold saved us. Because they threw themselves at the gold, and \\nMamma grabbed Papa, who was trying to breathe. They had closed his mouth, \\nbound his hands, and put a pillow and a chair on his face . . . They had \\nshoved something into his mouth so he would suffocate. Mamma grabbed him and \\ntore all that stuff off . . . He had something in his mouth, he was having \\ntrouble breathing, his nose was filled with blood. Mamma grabbed him and \\nstarted running from the fifth down to the first floor because no one wanted \\nto open their doors to them. Mamma said that by accident, completely by \\naccident that person opened his door, he was sleeping, and said, half-awake, \\n\"What\\'s happened?\" He sees that they are bloody. Mamma said, \"At least go and \\nfind out what\\'s happening to my daughters, even if they\\'ve burned them or \\nmurdered them, at least bring the corpses.\" He went looking for us. At that \\nmoment Lyuda was under the bed. She says that after they left it seemed that \\nsomeone was calling her name. When he quietly called her she couldn\\'t get out \\nfrom under the bed. She wanted to get out and was calling softly. She thought \\nshe was shouting, but in fact she was either silent or was only talking to \\nherself, it just seemed to her that she was shouting. When she got out from \\nunder the bed everyone was gone. And again . . . She thought that she had lost\\nher mind. I\\'ll never leave here, never! To hell with it! It just seems that \\nway to me, I\\'ll come to eventually. But then, when everything had settled \\ndown, stopped, that mall brought Lyuda down, and Igor carried me in from\\noutside. Or first I was brought in, then Lyuda, I don\\'t remember what order it\\nhappened in.\\n\\nAnd Mamma said, \"Listen, they\\'re all running around down there, shouting \\nsomething or other, and running toward the other building.\" It had more or \\nless calmed down where we were. Who\\'s dead, who\\'s alive, we don\\'t know. I \\ntried to call my girlfriend. I had basically come to. Mamma says, \"Listen;\\nlet\\'s go upstairs, at least get a mattress or something. We don\\'t know how \\nlong we\\'ll be here. Maybe they didn\\'t burn everything.\" I don\\'t get it, all\\nwomen have that feeling, they want to get something from their homes, maybe \\nnot everything was taken? I tell Mamma, \"Mamma, what do you need any of that \\nfor? To hell with it! We\\'re alive, forget the rest of it, all of it!\" She\\nsays, \"No, let\\'s go get at least something. Maybe we\\'ll leave here, spend the \\nnight at someone else\\'s.\" Mamma went upstairs, and their little boy, their son\\nAlik, was standing on the lookout. lIe was standing there to see if they were \\ncoming. They only managed to run up there and grab something one time. He \\nshouts, \"Come back, they\\'re coming!\" They didn\\'t have enough time to get a \\nlot, mattresses from one apartment, a blanket from another . . . Mamma got my \\nknitting . . . Someone managed to grab our old things, the ones we never wore,\\nout of the hall . . . Someone took Father\\'s old coveralls. The neighbor, his \\nwife, Mamma and Papa . . . Marina went with them. I was in no condition to \\nleave. Neither was Lyuda. We just sat. They ran out and we closed the door and\\njust then we hear that the mob is on its way toward our place upstairs, \\nthey\\'re dragging something again. They were going toward the other building, \\nmaybe over by the school, or . . . There was an unfinished building over\\nthere, people said they were going toward the basement or the unfinished \\nbuilding, they could gradually carry everything over there. Then things more \\nor less calmed down. I tried to call my boss.\\n\\nLater there was more noise. We were on the third floor, in a one-bedroom\\napartment, and a woman lives in the one-bedroom place on the second floor,\\nAsya Dallakian. She\\'s an old woman, retired. She wasn\\'t at home, at that\\ntime she was usually in the country, she has a married daughter there, and\\nher grandson is in the army. She is only very rarely in town; she gets her\\nretirement money and the apartment is essentially vacant. They started\\npounding on her door and broke it down. She had two or three beds in there, \\nsomething like that, she\\'s a 60-to 70-year-old woman who really does not even \\nlive there. Probably she had some pots, a couple of metal bed frames and \\nmattresses, and a television. When her grandson came she bought a television. \\nThey started wrecking everything. I started getting sick again. I think, \"My \\nGod, what is going on around here? When will this end?\" We turned off the \\nlights and sat. As it turns out the people who weren\\'t afraid, the ones who \\nknew what was going on, knew not to turn off the lights. We didn\\'t know, but \\nthey didn\\'t come to where we were all the same. They all knew very well that \\nhe was a captain. He went out and closed the door, and we sat in his \\napartment. His last name was Kasumov. He\\'s an exserviceman, retired, works up \\nat the fire station at some plant or other. He went out and stood at his door.\\nThey tell him, \"Comrade Captain, don\\'t worry, we won\\'t harm you, you\\'re one of\\nus.\" He went upstairs, and they say, \"Aren\\'t you taking anything from this \\napartment?\" He says, \"I don\\'t need anything.\" And the women who were standing \\nin the yard . . . we have a basement, full of water . . . the women who were \\nstanding in the yard saw. Those guys, they left everything they stole on the \\nfirst floor and ran upstairs again. The women threw everything they had time \\nto into the basement, to save our property. Some things were left: dirty \\npillows, two or three other things and a rug. A guy came downstairs, really \\nmad, and he says, \"Where\\'s the rug? I just put it right here!\" They tell him, \\n\"Some guy came and took it and went off toward the school.\" He ran off in that\\ndirection.\\n\\nOh! I forgot the most important point. When Igor picked me up in his arms, \\nthere were women standing there who saw everything that was going on. They \\njust didn\\'t tell me about it for a long time. The wife of that military man, \\nshe didn\\'t want to kill my spirit, I was already dead enough. Later she told \\nme, that after they murdered Uncle Shurik in the third entryway one of them, \\nthe ringleader, apparently a young man, said, \"Where\\'s the girl who was here?\"\\nAnd he became furious. The woman tells him, \"She came to . . . \" She didn\\'t\\nknow what to say: Think something up? Someone carried her off? Then they would\\ncomb the whole house and find me and our whole family. So the woman says, \"She\\ncame to and went to the basement.\" Now, our basement is full of water. So the \\nwhole mob dashes off to the basement to look for me or my corpse. They took \\nflashlights; they were up to their waists in water, water which had been \\nstanding there for years, and soot, and fuel oil. They climbed down in there \\nto get me. Then one of them said, \"There\\'s so much water down there, she \\nprobably walked and walked and then passed out and died. She met her death in \\nthe basement. That\\'s it, we can leave, no problem!\" I didn\\'t know that, and \\nwhen I was told, I felt worse. Two times worse. A lot worse! So they didn\\'t \\njust want to pound me flat, something more awful was awaiting me . . .\\n\\nAfter that we of course didn\\'t want to live in Sumgait any longer. We really \\ndidn\\'t want to go back to our apartment. When we moved, I went up there and \\nstarted to quiver and shake all over, because I started remembering it all. \\nAlthough the neighbors all sobbed, it was all . . . so cheap . . . The people \\nwho sat in their apartments and didn\\'t help us at a time like that. I think \\nthat they could have helped! I don\\'t think that they were obligated to, but \\nthey could have helped us! Because that one woman was able to stop that whole \\nbrutal crowd by herself. That means they could have, too. It would have been\\nenough foe one man or women to say, What do you think you\\'re doing?\" That\\'s \\nall! That would have done it. There were 60 apartments in our building. Not \\none person said it! When I was lying on the ground and all those people were \\nstanding on their balconies I didn\\'t hear anyone\\'s voice, no one said what are\\nyou doing, leave her alone . . . Mamma even told one of the neighbor women \\nthat if it had been an Azerbaijani woman in my place they would have dropped a\\nbomb if it would have killed even one Armenian. They would have stood up for \\none of their own. True, they say that our neighbor from the fourth entryway, \\nan old/ sick woman tried to stop the pogrom. The Azerbaijanis have a custom: \\nif a woman takes her scarf and throws it on the ground, the men are supposed \\nto stop immediately. The old woman from the fourth entryway did that, but they\\nstomped her scarf into the ground, pushed her off to the side, and said, \"If\\nyou want to go on living, you\\'ll disappear into your apartment.\" So she left.\\nThat trick didn\\'t work on them.\\n\\nEven the neighbors who helped us move told me, OK, fine, calm down, forget \\nthat it happened. I said I\\'d only forget it if I told them right then that it\\nhad happened to their daughter--and if that didn\\'t have any effect on them, \\nthen I would forget everything, too. Imagine that it happened to your sister. \\nAnd no one did anything. Anything.\\n\\n   April 25, 1988\\n   Yerevan\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t- - - reference - - -\\n\\n[1] _The Sumgait Tragedy; Pogroms against Armenians in Soviet Azerbaijan,\\n    Volume I, Eyewitness Accounts_, edited by Samuel Shahmuradian, forward by\\n    Yelena Bonner, 1990, published by Aristide D.

       " \"Remember roads in America are NOT designed for speeds above 80 meaning they\\nwould be safe at 55-65. Roads like the Autobahn are smoother, straiter,\\nwider and slightly banked. \\n\\nExample: A few months back I was traveling late at  night ( 3:00 am or so)\\nand I was changing highways at a bent crosssing.

       " 'I wrote :\\n  Nice strawman indeed.  The discussion is not about whether there were\\ntanks\\n  used in sixties riots; instead, it is about whether those tanks fired\\ntheir\\n  main guns in one of those riots.  You claim they did.  That claim is\\n  ludicrous.\\n\\nAwesley replied:\\n     I repeated what I had been told, under what context I had heard it,\\n  supporting the claim that tanks were indeed used in Detroit in 67.\\n\\nThe issue has never been whether tanks were used in Detroit in 1967.  It\\nhas been whether they fired their main guns.  You did not merely claim that\\ntanks were used--you claimed that they fired their main guns to suppress\\nsniper fire and that they were \"quite\" effective at this.  You continue to\\nback away from this claim and defend something else that nobody is\\ndisputing.\\n\\nAwesley went on:\\n  I\\n  spent a few minutes in a library today -- found their computer was\\n  down and they don\\'t have a card catalog.  Anyway, it took about 10\\n  minutes to find this in _Nightmare in Detroit, A Rebellion and It\\'s\\n  Victims_ by Sauter and Hines, on page 133, telling of the death of\\n  Tonia Blanding, age 4.\\n   \\n        \"When the tank was fired upon by snipers it turned in the direction\\n  the shots came from. [...] the fifty-caliber machine gun mounted on the\\n  tank belched fire into the buildings.  After a short round into the front\\n  of the buildings, the tank guns spit again, tearing apart huge holes out\\n  of the side of the apartment.\"\\n  \\n       Well, it\\'s not the main gun.  \\n\\n\"Well, it\\'s not the main gun.\"  Gee, that\\'s only the entire point.  Are you\\nnow going to admit that you were wrong?\\n\\n  will I see any pictures of tanks firing their main\\n  guns?  Will I see pictures of buildings damaged by the shells?  Will I\\nread\\n  the reports of the tank fire?  I\\'ll bet you dollar to doughnuts I won\\'t. \\n  It will take more than second-hand accounts from a few old National Guard\\n  sergeants shooting the shit to convince me that tanks shelled American\\n  cities in the Sixties.\\n\\nAwesley replied:\\n    Well, if you bothered to read them, it wouldn\\'t take long at all to\\n  find reports of tank * fire * -- although not necessarily of the main\\n  guns.\\n\\nI will never read of tanks firing their main guns in Detroit in the \\'67\\nriots.  There is simply no way that such an event could have taken place\\nwithout it being common knowledge even 26 years later.  The American\\nmilitary firing shells from tanks in American cities on blacks would have\\nbeen *big* news.\\n\\nAwesley goes on:\\n  You can also read of the troops using grenade launchers.\\n\\nTo fire fragmentary grenades?  I doubt that as well.  To fire concussion\\ngrenades?  Perhaps.  To fire tear gas?  Certainly.  But you would be\\nperfectly willing to let us believe they fired frags, wouldn\\'t you, since\\nit makes your other claim seem more plausible.\\n\\nAnd on:\\n  I don\\'t\\n  expect to convince you; you\\'ll have to open your mind and eyes and\\nactually\\n  do a little research to be convinced one way or the other.  Let me know\\n  what you find.\\n\\nI already know what you found: nothing.  If I claimed that the Marines used\\nF-4s to launch rockets at buildings in Trenton, New Jersey would you\\nbelieve me?  Would you suspend judgment until you had a chance to research\\nit?  Or would your bullshit filters kick in?\\n\\nIf tanks had fired their main guns in Detroit, people would have been\\nscreaming about it for the past two and half decades.  I would know about\\nit.  Unless you also claim that the National Guard managed to cover it up. \\nIf your mind is open enough to believe that, well, good for you.  I prefer\\nto live in reality.   And here in reality, I find it hard to believe that\\nthose tanks even had any shells, much less fired them.',\n",

       " \"\\n\\nDr. Goebels thought that a lie repeated enough times could finally \\nbe believed. I have been observing that 'Poly' has been practicing \\nGoebels' rule quite loyally. 'Poly's audience is mostly made of Greeks \\nwho are not allowed to listen to Turkish news. However, in today's \\ninformed world Greek propagandists can only fool themselves. For \\ninstance, those who lived in 1974 will remember the TV news they \\nwatched and the newspapers they read and the younger generation can \\nread the American newspapers of July and August 1974 to find out what \\nreally happened. \\n\\nThere are in Turkiye the Greek Hospital, The Greek Girls' Lycee \\nAlumni Association, the Principo Islands Greek Benevolent Society, \\nthe Greek Medical Foundation, the Principo Greek Orphanage Foundation, \\nthe Yovakimion Greek Girls' Lycee Foundation, and the Fener Greek \\nMen's Lycee Foundation.  \\n\\nAs for Greece, the longstanding use of the adjective 'Turkish' \\nin titles and on signboards is prohibited. The Greek courts \\nhave ordered the closure of the Turkish Teachers' Association, \\nthe Komotini Turkish Youth Association and the Ksanti \\nTurkish Association on grounds that there are no Turks\\nin Western Thrace. Such community associations had been \\nactive until 1984. But they were first told to remove\\nthe word 'Turkish' on their buildings and on their official\\npapers and then eventually close down. This is also the \\nfinal verdict (November 4, 1987) of the Greek High Court.\\n\\nIn the city of Komotini, a former Greek Parliamentarian of Turkish\\nparentage, was sentenced recently to 18 months of imprisonment\\nwith no right to appeal, just for saying outloud that he was\\nof Turkish descent. This duly-elected ethnic Turkish official\\nwas also deprived of his political rights for a period of three \\nyears. Each one of these barbaric acts seems to be none other than \\na vehicle, used by the Greek governments, to cover-up their inferiority \\ncomplex they display, vis-a-vis, the people of Turkiye. \\n\\nThe Agreement on the Exchange of Minorities uses the term 'Turks,' \\nwhich demonstrates what is actually meant by the previous reference \\nto 'Muslims.' The fact that the Greek governments also mention the \\nexistence of a few thousand non-Turkish Muslims does not change the \\nessential reality that there lives in Western Thrace a much bigger \\nTurkish minority. The 'Pomaks' are also a Muslim people, whom all the \\nthree nations (Bulgarians, Turks, and Greeks) consider as part of \\nthemselves. Do you know how the Muslim Turkish minority was organized \\naccording to the agreements? Poor 'Poly.'\\n\\nIt also proves that the Turkish people are trapped in Greece \\nand the Greek people are free to settle anywhere in the world.\\nThe Greek authorities deny even the existence of a Turkish\\nminority. They pursue the same denial in connection with \\nthe Macedonians of Greece. Talk about oppression. In addition,\\nin 1980 the 'democratic' Greek Parliament passed Law No. 1091,\\nvirtually taking over the administration of the vakiflar and\\nother charitable trusts. They have ceased to be self-supporting\\nreligious and cultural entities. Talk about fascism. The Greek \\ngovernments are attempting to appoint the muftus, irrespective\\nof the will of the Turkish minority, as state official. Although\\nthe Orthodox Church has full authority in similar matters in\\nGreece, the Muslim Turkish minority will have no say in electing\\nits religious leaders. Talk about democracy.\\n\\nThe government of Greece has recently destroyed an Islamic \\nconvention in Komotini. Such destruction, which reflects an \\nattitude against the Muslim Turkish cultural heritage, is a \\nviolation of the Lausanne Convention as well as the 'so-called' \\nGreek Constitution, which is supposed to guarantee the protection \\nof historical monuments. \\n\\nThe government of Greece, on the other hand, is building new \\nchurches in remote villages as a complementary step toward \\nHellenizing the region.\\n\\nAnd you pondered. Sidiropoulos, the president of the Macedonian Human \\nRights Committee, became the latest victim of a tactic long used by \\nthe Greeks to silence critics of policies of forced assimilation \\nof the Macedonian minority. A forestry official by occupation, \\nSidiropoulos has been sent to 'internal exile' on the island of \\nKefalonia, hundreds of kilometers away from his native Florina. \\nHis employer, the Florina City Council, asked him to depart in \\n24 hours. The Greek authorities are trying to punish him for his \\ninvolvement in Copenhagen. He returned to Florina by his own choice \\nand remains without a job. \\n\\nHelsinki Watch, a well-known Human Rights group, had been investigating \\nthe plight of the Turkish Minority in Greece. In August 1990, their \\nfindings were published in a report titled \\n\\n 'Destroying Ethnic Identity: Turks of Greece.'\\n\\nThe report confirmed gross violations of the Human Rights of the \\nTurkish minority by the Greek authorities. It says for instance, \\nthe Greek government recently destroyed an Islamic convent in \\nKomotini. Such destruction, which reflects an attitude against \\nthe Muslim Turkish cultural heritage, is a violation of the \\nLausanne Convention. \\n\\nThe Turkish cemeteries in the village of Vafeika and in Pinarlik\\nwere attacked, and tombstones were broken. The cemetery in\\nKarotas was razed by bulldozers.\\n\\nShall I go on? Why not? The people of Turkiye are not going \\nto take human rights lessons from the Greek Government. The \\ndiscussion of human rights violations in Greece does not \\nstop at the Greek frontier. In several following articles \\nI shall dwell on and expose the Greek treatment of Turks\\nin Western Thrace and the Aegean Macedonians.\\n\\nIt has been reported that the Greek Cypriot administration \\nhas an intense desire for arms and that Greece has made \\nplans to supply it with the tanks and armored vehicles it \\nhas to destroy in accordance with the agreement reached on \\nconventional arms reductions in Europe. Meanwhile, Greek \\nand Greek Cypriot officials are reported to have planned \\nto take ostentatious measures aimed at camouflaging the \\ntransfer of these tanks and armored vehicles to southern \\nCyprus, a process that will conflict with the spirit of \\nthe agreement on conventional arms reduction in Europe.\\n\\nAn acceptable method may certainly be found when there\\nis a will. But we know of various kinds of violent\\nbehaviors ranging from physical attacks to the burning\\nof buildings. The rugs at the Amfia village mosque were \\ndragged out to the front of the building and burnt there. \\nShots were fired on the mosque in the village of Aryana.\\n\\nNow wait, there is more.\\n\\n  'Greek Atrocities in the Vilayet of Smyrna (May to July 1919), Inedited\\n  Documents and Evidence of English and French Officers,' Published by\\n  The Permanent Bureau of the Turkish Congress at Lausanne, Lausanne,\\n  Imprimerie Petter, Giesser & Held, Caroline, 5 (1919).\\n\\n  pages 82-83:\\n\\n<< 1.

The following are quotes of his speech: \\n\\n``Kuwait itself was an entity identified as Kuwait even before \\nIraq was identified as Iraq in the Ottoman Empire. Kuwait was in \\nexistence since 1752. We continued to be in existence until the \\nconflict between the Ottoman Empire and the British and others in the \\narea. Thereafter, we signed with the British in 1899 a protective \\nagreement whereby the British guaranteed the sovereignty and security \\nof Kuwait.\\'\\' \\n\\n``In 1913, the British and the Ottoman signed an agreement defining \\nwithout any doubt the borders of Kuwait as they stand today. Such an \\nagreement was reconfirmed in 1932 between the Kuwaiti government \\nand the Iraqi government at that time. That is when Iraq became a state, \\nafter Kuwait itself.\\'\\' \\n\\n``In 1961, when we declared our independence Iraq seized the \\nopportunity to claim Kuwait as part of Iraq. There were threats. The \\nBritish came in, and Arab forces came in to guarantee the sovereignty \\nand territorial integrity of Kuwait. In 1963, Kuwait and Iraq again \\nsigned border agreement, thereby defining our territory and Iraq\\'s \\nrecognition to the sovereignty and territory of Kuwait.\\'\\' \\n\\n---Compiled by Firyal Alshalalbi \\n\\n\\nOrigins of Kuwait \\n\\nThe establishment of Kuwait is attributed to Barrak b. Ghurair of the \\nBani Khalid who used Kuwait as a summer residence. The beginning of \\nKuwait goes back to the late 17th century and some historians go \\nfurther up to 1611. Kuwait\\'s name is derived from al-Kut which means \\nfortress. Kuwait is also called Qurain, which is the diminutive of qarn, a \\nhorn or hill. Kuwait town flourished and grew since its \\nestablishment. \\n\\nThe \\'Utub, al-Sabah family is a branch of \\'Utub, settled in Kuwait \\nduring the early 18th century. They lived under the protection \\nof Bani Khalid until 1752. After that, they became independent and \\nSabah Bin Jabir was chosen as the first ruler for \\'Utub. \\n\\nCarsten Niebuhr (1733-1815) a Dutch explorer was among the first who \\nwrote about the Arabia. He was the mathematician in the scientific \\nexpedition sent in 1760 by the King of Denmark to Arabia. He \\ndocumented details of Arab tribes inhabiting both coasts of the Gulf \\nand in the case of Kuwait, he was the first writer to give the two \\nnames by which the town was known, Kuwait and Qurain. Niebuhr\\'s chart \\nof the Persian Gulf was the best one drawn before the end of that \\ncentury, see the map from Abu Hakima, History of Eastern Arabia \\n1750-1800. pub.1965. \\n\\nAl-Sabah (\\'Utub) kept good relations with other powers in the eastern \\nArabia. According to Ahmed Abu Hakima\\'s conclusions in his well \\ndocumented study about the history of eastern Arabia between 1750-1800, \\nthere was no Ottoman rule on the region. ``In the second half of \\nthe 18th century, there was no Ottoman ruler in Eastern Arabia. \\nIn fact, Ottoman rule was not even nominally acknowledged. Their \\nattempts to restore their lost position in al-Hasa through the \\ncampaign of Thuwayni in 1786, and Ali Pasha\\'s expedition against the \\nWahhabis in 1798, were unsuccessful. At Kuwait, the nearest point of \\nthe Utbi domains to the Ottoman Mutasallimiyya of Basra, the Shaikh \\nwas under no form of Ottoman control. The aim of \\'Utbi external policy \\nwas to keep on friendly relations with all the forces working in the \\nGulf.\\'\\' (p. 182-183) Abu Hakima continued in his conclusions that ``Kuwait \\nwas not a dependency of Basra, the Persian occupation of Basra \\n(1775-79) did not affect Kuwait.\\'\\' (p.183) \\n\\nKuwait had its own identity through the Ottoman domination on the Arab \\nworld. This identity was clear to the British and the French who \\ntried to win the support of Kuwait\\'s Sheikh between 1793-95 when the \\nBritish wanted his support in their conflict with the French in the \\nGulf area. \\n\\n--- \\n\\nIndependent Kuwait \\n\\nThis is the first of a series of articles that testify to the \\nindependence of Kuwait throughout its history from both Iraq and the \\nOttomans. \\n\\nThe following text is related to an expedition carried out by the \\nOttomans in 1871 against the Wahhabis in Eastern Arabia (where the oil fields \\nin Saudi Arabia now). Kuwait and its ruler at that time, Sheikh \\nAbdulla Ibn Sabah Ibn Jabir, allied themselves with the Turks:} \\n\\nAbdullah\\' role in the fighting was not a minor one. He joined the \\nexpedition as a commander of the large Kuwaiti fleet and was the first \\nto use its guns against the besieged town of Al-Qatif. Had it not been \\nfor this bombardment by the Kuwaiti fleet, Al-Qatif obviously would \\nnot have surrendered in a mere three hours. \\n\\nIn relation to this, a question arises as to why the Ottoman warships \\nrefrained from participating in the bombardment. The answer lies in \\nreports relating to the political movements that preceded accounts of \\nthe progress of the expedition. Because the Ottomans were unwilling to \\njeopardize the maritime peace imposed by Britain in the area,  the \\nSultan and the Pasha promised their warships would not be used in the \\nwar against Su\\'ud or any Sheikh in the war zone. Kuwait, which was not \\na party  to the above-mentioned treaty of 1861, was under no such \\nobligation especially since the expedition was not directed against \\nthose who had signed it. \\n\\n\\n[ From the above text, we can see that Kuwait was not part of the \\nOttomans or the British colonies. For more details about the mentioned \\nexpedition, please check out the source of the above text: \\n\\nThe Modern History of Kuwait, 1750--1965, by Ahmed Abu-Hakima, McGill \\nUniversity, Canada ] \\n\\n--- \\n\\nIndependent Kuwait--2 \\n\\nThis is another article of a series of articles that testify to the \\nindependence of Kuwait throughout its history from both Iraq and the \\nOttomans. \\n\\nThe following text discusses a dispute on an estate called Sufiyya in Zubair, \\nIraq, between the Sheikh of Kuwait and Al-Zuhair tribe in Zubair. \\n\\nIn 1866, trouble developed over the possession by Sheikh Sabah of the \\nestate which was [purchased] by his father, Sheikh Jabir, in 1836. This \\nproperty was sequestered by a Turkish Qa\\'immaqam [representative] on \\nthe basis of a claim by the Al-Zuhair that the vendor had been the \\nowner of a share and not of the n 100e Sufiyya. At the same time, \\nSheikh Sabah was required to expel from other lands owned by him at \\nthe island of Fao some cultivators who had immigrated from Persian \\nterritory. \\n\\nIt should be recalled that  the Turkish officials from the start \\nshowed strong prejudice in favor of the Zuhair claimants. Abdulla Ibn \\nSabah,  the eldest son of the ruler of Kuwait who went to Basra as his \\nfather\\'s agent in the case,  narrowly escaped being thrown  into jail \\nupon his refusal to make a payment amounting to the value of seven \\nyears produce which the Ottoman authorities deemed the plaintiffs were \\nentitled to receive. \\n\\nEventually, the dispute was settled by the Wali [Governor] of Baghdad \\nin favor of the Sheikh of Kuwait. The decision of the Governor of \\nBasra in favor of the Sheikh was apparently made for various reasons. \\nSome writers think that the Governor wanted to win Abdulla over to the \\nTurkish side, and suggest that the Governor, Namiq Pasha, even offered \\nhim the title of Qa\\'immaqam, which he declined. Nevertheless,  the \\nproceedings of the Turks in this case were regarded by the inhabitants \\nof Kuwait as attempts to cause a confrontation with Zubair. It seems \\nthat they had anticipated a conflict and according to reports by the \\nBritish Agent at Basra, the people of Kuwait were prepared to a man to \\nabandon their town rather than submit to Turkish rule. Lorimer suggests \\nthat the final order of Namiq Pasha, upholding the Kuwait Sheikh\\'s \\ntitle to Sufiyya, was perhaps due to a report that Sheikh Sabah, \\n``with the object of attacking Zubair if the decision should go \\nagainst him, had obtained a promise of countenance and armed support \\nfrom the Wahhabi Amir.\\'\\' \\n\\nIn addition to this legal matter with Zubair, Kuwait had had other \\nproblems with Basra whose courts tried to jail Abdulla Ibn Sabah, as \\nexplained above. However, Kuwait\\'s relations with the Ottoman \\nmutasallims of Basra had at times been amicable and in several \\ninstances, those mutasallims even sought refuge at Kuwait when \\npressured by the Pashas of Baghdad who exercised control over them. \\n\\n[ Source: The Modern History of Kuwait, 1750--1965, by Ahmed Abu-Hakima, \\nMcGill University, Canada ] \\n\\n--- \\n\\nIndependent Kuwait--3 \\n\\nThis is another article that testifies to the \\nindependence of Kuwait throughout its history from both Iraq and the \\nOttomans. \\n\\n\\nWhen Pelly [Colonel Pelly, the British Resident in the Gulf] visited Kuwait \\nfor the first time on March 3, 1863, he was \\nmet at Jahra by Sheikh Mubarak, the second son of the ruler, Sheikh \\nSabah. Just before he reached Kuwait town on March 4, he was met by \\nSheikh Abdulla, the eldest son and heir apparent, who accompanied him \\nto the town gate on their way to ``a very good home,\\'\\' which had been \\nprepared for Pelly and his companions. ``Scarcely had we entered it,\\'\\' \\nsays Pelly, ``when Sheikh Sabah himself came.\\'\\' \\nThis description of Pelly\\'s reception indicates that to a certain \\ndegree it was run according to protocol. \\n\\nThe government system of Kuwait and administration of justice were the \\nsubject of comments made by Pelly. ``The Government is patriarchal,\\'\\' \\nsays Pelly, ``the Sheikh managing the political, and the Cazee [Qadi] \\nthe judicial departments. The Sheikh himself would submit to the \\nCazee\\'s decision.\\'\\' Punishment was rarely inflicted. ``Indeed, there \\nseems little government interference anywhere, and little need of an \\narmy.\\'\\' Pelly in admiration of how the Sheikh ran the affairs of the \\ncountry, retold the following remark which the Sheikh had made to him: \\n\\nWhen my father was nearly 120 years old, he called me and said, ``I \\nshall soon die. I have made no fortune, and can leave you no money, \\nbut I have made many and true friends, grapple them.

Hold to my policy, and \\nthough you are surrounded by  desert, and pressed by a once hostile \\nand still wandering set of tribes, you will prosper.\\'\\' \\n\\n[ Source: The Modern History of Kuwait, 1750--1965, by Ahmed Abu-Hakima, \\nMcGill University, Canada ] \\n\\n--- \\n\\nIndependent Kuwait--4 \\n\\nThis is another article that testifies to the \\nindependence of Kuwait throughout its history from both Iraq and the \\nOttomans. \\n\\n\\nThe British had always regarded Sheikh Jabir as a ``good friend,\\'\\' but \\nin October 1839, an event took place at Kuwait which could have \\nweakened those good relations. On October 30, Lieutenant Edmunds, the \\nAssistant Resident at Abu Shahr [in Iran], arrived in Kuwait on  a \\nspecial mission from the Resident, Captain Hennell. His mission was to \\nfind out if Kuwait was willing to welcome the establishment of a \\nBritish line of post across the desert from Kuwait to the \\nMediterranean. The British war vessel fired the usual salute in honor \\nof the Sheikh after it had anchored in the waters of Kuwait Bay. The \\nsalute was not acknowledged and Edmunds waited in the vessel for three \\ndays before he was able to communicate with the Sheikh. \\n\\nAfter Edmunds\\' return to Abu Shahr, both he and Captain Hennell \\nexplained this unusual behavior of the Sheikh, to have been due not \\nto ill-will, but principally to a desire to mislead the Egyptian agent \\nat Kuwait as to the nature of his relations with the British. \\nTherefore, they considered that Jabir\\'s conduct did not indicate any \\nchange in his friendly policies towards the British. \\n\\nIf the British tolerated the attitude of Jabir towards Edmunds, so \\nalso did the Egyptians. Earlier in the same year, some of the most \\nwanted men in the Wahhabi camp, such as \\'Umar Ibn \\'Ufaisan, the \\nWahhabi general  in Al-Hasa, and Wahhabi tribes like Al-Duwaish, \\nsought refuge in Kuwait. \\n\\nProtection of refugees seeking political \\nasylum in his country was a policy that had been adopted earlier by \\nSheikh Abdulla Ibn Sabah. This can, therefore, be looked upon as an \\nindication of self-confidence; an outcome of Kuwait\\'s independence \\nfrom foreign powers. It corroborates the fact that Kuwait, if \\nnecessary, was prepared to defend itself against more powerful \\nneighbors. \\n\\nThis defense depended not only on the walls of the city, but also on \\nbedouin tribes in its neighborhood and a merchant fleet equipped with \\nthe necessary guns comparable to other Arab fleets of the time. \\n\\nAs to Kuwait\\'s position between 1815 and 1839, one can safely state \\nthat it managed to maintain a neutral policy with regard to the \\nstruggling Wahhabis and Egyptians. Relations with the British  and \\neven with the Pasha of Baghdad continued on good terms. \\n\\n[ Source: The Modern History of Kuwait, 1750--1965, by Ahmed Abu-Hakima, \\nMcGill University, Canada ] \\n\\n--- \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  They were trying to recover land they believed \\n  was theirs, much like the Argentines in the Faulklands.

Jews\\nhave been heavily discriminated against on the grounds of religion in\\nmany Christian countries.

If a Jew\\nconverted there were no legal barriers in his way (that I know of anyway.)\\nPeter the Great's Interior Minister came from such a convert background.\\nCan we then claim that the Russian Orthodox did not teach AntiSemitism\\nand was not AntiSemitic? Similarly for the Roman Catholic Church? I\\nsuspect so as this is not a racial 'taint' but one based on belief\\nand AS is after all a form of racism. Well maybe not. What is\\nAntiSemitism then if not something racially based? I wonder if Hitler\\nkilled converts of 'pure' German blood. Does anyone know one way or\\nthe other?\\n\\nJoseph Askew\\n\",\n",

The Administration is \\nannouncing a number of steps today in order to underscore its \\ndeep commitment to a new and closer partnership with Russia based \\non its government's commitment to reform.\\n\\n\\nExecutive Review of Cold War Laws\\n\\nPresident Clinton and President Yeltsin discussed the \\ndesirability of reviewing and updating U.S. laws and regulations \\nto reflect the end of the Cold War.  Congress has already acted \\nto revise many laws to reflect the fact that a communist Soviet \\nUnion has been replaced by a democratic Russia and other \\nindependent states.  However, many laws and regulations remain \\nthat contain language and restrictions that fail to reflect the \\nend of the Cold War and that unnecessarily undermine relations \\nwith Russia and the other new independent states.\\n\\nThe President today has ordered an Executive review of laws and \\nregulations so that, where appropriate and consistent with U.S. \\nsecurity and other national interests, such provisions can be \\nrevised or removed.  He has asked Ambassador-at-large Strobe \\nTalbott to coordinate this review on an expedited basis.  The \\nPresident has indicated that he will welcome congressional \\nefforts to help this review proceed as quickly as possible.\\n\\nThis review will weigh all considerations that pertain to \\nrevision of such provisions, and the initiation of the review may \\nhelp to remedy some of the circumstances that have justified such \\nprovisions in the past.  For example, because the Russians are \\neager to have their status changed under the Jackson-Vanik \\nlegislation, President Yeltsin personally assured President \\nClinton in Vancouver that he would look into individual cases \\ninvolving continuing restrictions on emigration from Russia.  By \\naddressing such issues, this review can help strengthen the bonds \\nof trust and partnership between the U.S. and Russia, and between\\nthe U.S. and the other new independent states.\\n\\n\\nReview of COCOM\\n\\nIt is also time to consider expeditiously with America's allies \\nthe future of another Cold War institution -- the Coordinating \\nCommittee for Multilateral Export Controls (COCOM).  The United \\nStates has begun a thorough review of how to reorient export \\ncontrols to the post-Cold War world, in which Russia is no longer \\nviewed as a potential adversary, but as a potential ally in \\ncombatting the proliferation of sensitive technology.\\n\\nSteps to Improve the Security Relationship\\n\\nThe President also has taken steps to move ahead on a range of \\nefforts discussed in Vancouver that can strengthen U.S. security \\nand improve our security relationship with the Russians and the \\nother states.\\n\\n\\nAccelerated Deactivation of Nuclear Weapons\\n\\nIn Vancouver, the two Presidents discussed accelerating the \\nprocess of deactivating nuclear strategic systems scheduled for \\nelimination under the START I Treaty.  President Clinton has \\ndirected the Department of Defense to complete this process well \\nin advance of the seven year reduction period outlined in START \\nI.  In addition, the United States, together with Russia and the \\nother relevant states of the former Soviet Union, will be \\nexploring programs under Nunn-Lugar to help them to accelerate \\nthis process.\\n\\n\\nMultilateral Test Ban\\n\\nThe two Presidents agreed at Vancouver that negotiations on a \\nmultilateral nuclear test ban should commence at an early date, \\nand that the two governments would consult with each other \\naccordingly.  The United States looks forward to beginning \\nconsultations with Russia, our allies, and other states, on the \\nspecific issues related to this negotiation.  The United States \\nexpects to start this consultative process within the next two \\nmonths.    \\n\\n\\nDetargeting\\n\\nThe two Presidents also began a dialogue on the issue of nuclear \\ntargeting at Vancouver.  As the United States and Russia move \\ninto a new relationship of strategic partnership, there is a need \\nto reexamine many of the assumptions and means employed in the \\npast to safeguard U.S. security against a nuclear adversary.  The \\nAdministration is beginning a comprehensive review of measures \\nthat could enhance strategic stability, including recent \\nproposals for detargeting nuclear missiles.   \\n\\nOther Measures to Create a New Security Relationship\\n\\nIn response to the incident involving a collision between US and \\nRussian submarines last month, Secretary Aspin will be ready to \\ndiscuss ways to avoid such incidents in the future with Russian \\nDefense Minister Grachev during his visit to the United States in \\nlate May.\\n\\nSecretary Aspin will also be prepared to move forward with \\nDefense Minister Grachev in May to develop a combined training \\nprogram between our two military forces and to prepare for joint \\nexercises in peacekeeping, such as that authorized by the UN \\nSecurity Council.  The United States looks forward to broadening \\nsuch training and exercises to include other peacekeeping \\ncontributors, in order to improve inter-operability, readiness, \\nand planning for multilateral peacekeeping operations.  The US \\nand Russia are working together to convene a May Ministerial \\nMeeting of the UN Security Council to discuss proposals for \\nenhancing the UN's peacekeeping capability and to move \\nconsideration of the Secretary-General's Agenda for Peace from \\nthe discussion to the implementation phase.  The U.S. is also \\nworking with the Russians to focus specifically on improvements \\nin the financing and management of UN operations.  The purpose of \\nthese initiatives will be to cooperate on peacekeeping for our \\nparticipation in UN or CSCE sponsored actions.\\n\\n\\nMultilateral and Bilateral Partnership with Reform\\n\\nFinally, the Administration continues to move ahead on a range of \\ninitiatives aimed at striking a partnership with economic and \\npolitical reformers throughout Russia and the other states.  The \\nAdministration is continuing work with our G-7 partners to \\nassemble the package of multilateral assistance that Secretaries \\nBentsen and Christopher recently negotiated in Tokyo.  And the \\nAdministration is continuing consultation with Congress over the \\nfurther efforts the U.S. will take to assist the process of \\nreform in Russia and the other states.\\n\\n                           *    *    *\\n\\nThe Administration believes these steps can increase American \\nsecurity while improving the relationship between the U.S. and \\nRussia, and between the U.S. and the other new independent \\nstates.\",\n",

Diplomats and aid\\nworkers say the death toll is in line with their own estimates.\\n\\nThe 25  February attack on Hojali  by Armenian forces was  one of\\nthe last moves  in their four-year campaign to  take full control\\nof Nagorny Karabakh,  the subject of a new  round of negotiations\\nin Rome on Monday. The bloodshed was something between a fighting\\nretreat and  a massacre, but  investigators say that most  of the\\ndead were civilians. The awful  number of people killed was first\\nsuppressed by  the fearful  former Communist government  in Baku.\\nLater  it  was blurred  by  Armenian  denials and  grief-stricken\\nAzerbaijan\\'s wild  and contradictory  allegations of up  to 2,000\\ndead.\\n\\nThe State Prosecuter, Aydin Rasulov,  the cheif investigator of a\\n15-man  team  looking  into  what Azerbaijan  calls  the  \"Hojali\\nDisaster\", said  his figure of 600  people dead was a  minimum on\\npreliminary  findings.  A similar  estimate  was  given by  Elman\\nMemmedov, the mayor of Hojali. An  even higher one was printed in\\nthe Baku newspaper  Ordu in May - 479 dead  people named and more\\nthan 200 bodies reported unidentified.  This figure of nearly 700\\ndead is quoted as official by Leila Yunusova, the new spokeswoman\\nof the Azeri Ministry of Defence.\\n\\nFranCois Zen  Ruffinen, head  of delegation of  the International\\nRed Cross  in Baku, said  the Muslim imam  of the nearby  city of\\nAgdam had reported a figure of  580 bodies received at his mosque\\nfrom  Hojali, most  of  them  civilians. \"We  did  not count  the\\nbodies. But  the figure seems  reasonable. It is no  fantasy,\" Mr\\nZen Ruffinen said. \"We have some idea since we gave the body bags\\nand products to wash the dead.\"\\n\\nMr  Rasulov endeavours  to give  an unemotional  estimate of  the\\nnumber of  dead in the  massacre. \"Don\\'t  get worked up.  It will\\ntake  several months  to  get a  final  figure,\" the  43-year-old\\nlawyer said at his small office.\\n\\nMr Rasulov  knows about these  things. It  took him two  years to\\nreach  a firm  conclusion that  131  people were  killed and  714\\nwounded  when  Soviet  troops  and tanks  crushed  a  nationalist\\nuprising in Baku in January 1990.\\n\\nThose  nationalists, the  Popular  Front, finally  came to  power\\nthree weeks  ago and  are applying pressure  to find  out exactly\\nwhat  happened when  Hojali, an  Azeri town  which lies  about 70\\nmiles from the border with Armenia, fell to the Armenians.\\n\\nOfficially, 184 people have so  far been certified as dead, being\\nthe  number of  people that  could be  medically examined  by the\\nrepublic\\'s forensic department. \"This  is just a small percentage\\nof the dead,\" said Rafiq Youssifov, the republic\\'s chief forensic\\nscientist. \"They were the only bodies brought to us. Remember the\\nchaos and the fact that we are  Muslims and have to wash and bury\\nour dead within 24 hours.\"\\n\\nOf these 184 people, 51 were women, and 13 were children under 14\\nyears old.  Gunshots killed  151 people,  shrapnel killed  20 and\\naxes or  blunt instruments  killed 10.  Exposure in  the highland\\nsnows killed the last three.  Thirty-three people showed signs of\\ndeliberate mutilation, including ears,  noses, breasts or penises\\ncut off and  eyes gouged out, according  to Professor Youssifov\\'s\\nreport. Those 184 bodies examined were less than a third of those\\nbelieved to have been killed, Mr Rasulov said.\\n\\nFiles  from  Mr  Rasulov\\'s  investigative  commission  are  still\\ndisorganised -  lists of 44  Azeri militiamen are dead  here, six\\npolicemen there,  and in handwriting  of a mosque  attendant, the\\nnames of  111 corpses brought to  be washed in just  one day.

That we have a CMA doctors\\nmonopoly is something that the American AMA-oriented medical lobby\\nNEVER tells you down here ...\\n\\n\\nNo, I respect people who do specialties (okay, all of my MD friends\\nare (-;) but there\\'s the question of our small market dynamics up\\nnorth ... if anything, that our private doctors and hospitals sell\\ntheir services to Americans to generate more business will inflate\\ntheir effective population served, and thus make some specialties\\nfinally viable (i.e., there will be enough customers).  We just do\\nnot have enough sick Canadians in absolute numbers otherwise.\\n\\n\\nUh ... Germany basically uses our method, with their many sickness\\nfunds.  The competition is fake if it exists at all, because they\\'re\\nall interlinked.  Look in Der Spiegel or Stern (my girlfriend is in\\nour German department  and her uncle is a private practicioner in\\nSaarbrucken) ... no ads for health insurance.  While Canada organizes\\nby province, Germany organizes the paperwork around big corporations\\nand regional offices.   But remember that we have provinces that have\\nthe same population as some major German corporations.  Germans have\\npublic health insurance, just that it is brokered by smaller entities\\n(actually, brokerage of basic by private firms who\\'ll sell extra\\ninsurance to fill out their policies, sort of a voucher system,\\nwas one of the first ideas floated in Canada, too).\\n\\nRemember, the Germans don\\'t have HMO\\'s ... a telling sign, \\'cos\\nRochester does and they\\'re also a company town.\\n\\n\\nI\\'ll have to let a Canadian MD jump in to verify that claim, but\\nI\\'ve come to learn to suspect anything in the American press about\\nour \"system\".  If much or some of it were true, you\\'d have to take\\nus for idiots for tolerating it.  And given that our insurance was\\ninstalled during a period when there were only Liberal and Tory\\ngovernments federally and provincially, and the socialists are still\\nchafing, they would\\'ve pressed for real socialized medicine to fix\\nthings ... think about it.

       " 'From: Center for Policy Research <cpr>\\nSubject: Symbiotics: Zionism-Antisemitism\\n\\n\\nZionism and the Holocaust\\n-------------------------- by Haim Bresheeth\\n\\nThe first point to note regarding the appropriation of the history\\nof the Holocaust by Zionist propaganda is that Zionism without\\nanti-semitism is impossible. Zionism agrees with the basic tenet\\nof anti-Semitism, namely that Jews cannot live with non- Jews.\\n\\nThe history and roots of the Holocaust go back a long way. While\\nthe industru of death and destruction did not operate before 1942,\\nits roots were firmly placed in the 19th Century. Jewish\\naspirations for emancipation emerged out of the national struggles\\nin Europe. When the hopes for liberation through\\nbourgeois-democratic change were dashed, other alternatives for\\nimproving the lot of the Jews of Europe achieved prominence.\\n\\nThe socialist Bund, a mass movement with enormous following, had\\nto contend with opposition from a new and small, almost\\ninsignificant opponent, the political Zionists.  In outline these\\ntwo offered diametrically opposed options for Jews in Europe.\\nWhile the Bund was suggesting joining forces with the rest of\\nEurope\\'s workers, the Zionists were proposing a new programme\\naimed at ridding Europe of its Jews by setting up some form of a\\nJewish state.\\n\\nHistorically, nothing is inevitable, all depends on the balance of\\nforces involved in the struggle. History can be seen as an option\\ntree: every time a certain option is chosen, other routes become\\nbarred. Because of that choice, movement backwards to the point\\nbefore that choice was made is impossible. While Zionism as an\\noption was taken by many young Jews, it remained a minority\\nposition until the first days of the 3rd Reich. The Zionist\\nFederation of Germany (ZVfD), an organisation representing a tiny\\nminority of German Jews, was selected by the Nazis as the body to\\nrepresent the Jews of the Reich. Its was the only flag of an\\ninterantional organisation allowed to fly in Berlin, and this was\\nthe only international organisation allowed to operate during this\\nperiod. From a marginal position, the leaders of the Zionist\\nFederation were propelled to a prominence and centrality that\\nsurprised even them. All of a sudden they attained political\\npower, power based not on representation, but from being selected\\nas the choice of the Nazi regime for dealing with the the \\'Jewish\\nproblem\\'. Their position in negotiating with the Nazis agreements\\nthat affected the lives of many tens of thousands of the Jews in\\nGermany transformed them from a utopian, marginal organisation in\\nGermany (and some other countries in Europe) into a real option to\\nbe considered by German Jews.\\n\\nThe best example of this was the \\'Transfer Agreement\\' of 1934.\\nImmediately after the Nazi takeover in 1933, Jews all over the\\nworld supported or were organising a world wide boycott of German\\ngoods. This campaign hurt the Nazi regime and the German\\nauthorities searched frantically for a way disabling the boycott.\\nIt was clear that if Jews and Jewish organisations were to pull\\nout, the campaign would collapse.\\n\\nThis problem was solved by the ZVfD. A letter sent to the Nazi\\nparty as early as 21.  June 1933, outlined the degree of agreement\\nthat existed between the two organisations on the question of\\nrace, nation, and the nature of the \\'Jewish problem\\', and it\\noffered to collaborate with the new regime:\\n\\n\"The realisation of Zionism could only be hurt by resentment of\\nJews abroad against the German development. Boycott propaganda -\\nsuch as is currently being carried out against Germany in many\\nways - is in essence unZionist, because Zionism wants not to do\\nbattle but to convince and build.\"\\n\\nIn their eagerness to gain credence and the backing of the new\\nregime, the Zionist organisation managed to undermine the boycott.\\nThe main public act was the signature of the \"Transfer Agreement\"\\nwith the Nazi authorities during the Zionist Congress of 1934. In\\nessence, the agreement was designed to get Germany\\'s Jews out of\\nthe country and into Mandate Palestine. It provided a possibility\\nfor Jews to take a sizeable part of their property out of the\\ncountry, through a transfer of German goods to Palestine. This\\nright was denied to Jews leaving to any other destination. The\\nZionist organisation was the acting agent, through its financial\\norganisations. This agreement operated on a number of fronts -\\n\\'helping\\' Jews to leave the country, breaking the ring of the\\nboycott, exporting German goods in large quantities to Palestine,\\nand last but not least, enabling the regime to be seen as humane\\nand reasonable even towards its avowed enemies, the Jews. After\\nall, they argued, the Jews do not belong in Europe and now the\\nJews come and agree with them.\\n\\nAfter news of the agreement broke, the boycott was doomed. If the\\nZionist Organization found it possible and necessary to deal with\\nthe Nazis, and import their goods, who could argue for a boycott ?\\nThis was not the first time that the interests of both movements\\nwere presented to the German public as complementary. Baron Von\\nMildenstein, the first head of the Jewish Department of the SS,\\nlater followed by Eichmann, was invited to travel to Palestine.\\nThis he did in early 1933, in the company of a Zionist leader,\\nKurt Tuchler. Having spent six months in Palestine, he wrote a\\nseries of favourable articles in Der STURMER describing the \\'new\\nJew\\' of Zionism, a Jew Nazis could accept and understand.\\n\\nThis little-known episode established quite clearly the\\nrelationship during the early days of Nazism, between the new\\nregime and the ZVfD, a relationship that was echoed later in a\\nnumber of key instances, even after the nature of the Final\\nSolution became clear. In many cases this meant a silencing of\\nreports about the horrors of the exterminations. A book\\nconcentrating on this aspect of the Zionist reaction to the\\nHolocaust is Post-Ugandan Zionism in the Crucible of the\\nHolocaust, by S. B. Beth-Zvi.\\n\\nIn the case of the Kastner episode, around which Jim Allen\\'s play\\nPERDITION is based, even the normal excuse of lack of knowledge of\\nthe real nature of events does not exist. It occured near the end\\nof the war. The USSR had advanced almost up to Germany. Italy and\\nthe African bases had been lost. The Nazis were on the run, with a\\nnumber of key countries, such as Rumania, leaving the Axis. A\\nsecond front was a matter of months away, as the western Allies\\nprepared their forces. In the midst of all this we find Eichmann,\\nthe master bureaucrat of industrial murder, setting up his HZ in\\noccupied Budapest, after the German takeover of the country in\\nApril 1944. His first act was to have a conference with the Jewish\\nleadership, and to appoint Zionist Federation members, headed by\\nKastner as the agent and clearing house for all Jews and their\\nrelationship with the SS and the Nazr authorities. Why they did\\nthis is not difficult to see. As opposed to Poland, where its\\nthree and  a half million Jews lived in ghettoes and were visibly\\ndifferent from the rest of the Polish population, the Hungarian\\nJews were an integrated part of the community. The middle class\\nwas mainly Jewish, the Jews were mainly middle-class. They enjoyed\\nfreedom of travel, served in the Hungarian (fascist) army in\\nfronline units, as officers and soldiers, their names were\\nHungarian - how was Eichmann to find them if they were to be\\nexterminated ? The task was not easy, there were a million Jews in\\nHungary, most of them resident, the rest being refugees from other\\ncountries. Many had  heard about the fate of Jews elsewhere, and\\nwere unlikely to believe any statements by Nazi officials.\\n\\nLike elsewhere, the only people who had the information and the\\near of the frightened Jewish population were the Judenrat. In this\\ncase the Judenrat comprsied mainly the Zionist Federation members.\\nWithout their help the SS, with 19 officers and less than 90 men,\\nplus a few hundred Hungarian police, could not have collected and\\ncontrolled a million Jews, when they did not even know their\\nwhereabouts. Kastner and the others were left under no illusions.\\nEichmann told Joel Brand, one of the members of Kastner\\'s\\ncommittee, that he intended to send all Hungary\\'s Jews to\\nAuschwitz, before he even started the expulsions!  He told them\\nclearly that all these Jews will die, 12,000 a day, unless certain\\nconditions were met.\\n\\nThe Committee faced a simple choice - to tell the Jews of Hungary\\nabout their fate, (with neutral Rumania, where many could escape,\\nbeing in most cases a few hours away) or to collaborate with the\\nNazis by assisting in the concentration process. What would not\\nhave been believed when coming from the SS, sounded quite\\nplausible when coming from the mouths of the Zionist leadership.\\nThus it is, that most of the Hungarian Jews went quietly to their\\ndeath, assured by their leadership that they were to be sent to\\nwork camps.\\n\\nTo be sure, there are thirty pieces of silver in this narrative of\\ndestruction: the trains of \\'prominents\\' which Eichmann promised to\\nKastner - a promise he kept to the last detail. For Eichmann it\\nwas a bargain: allowing 1,680 Jews to survive, as the price paid\\nfor the silent collaboration over the death of almost a million\\nJews.\\n\\nThere was no way in which the Jews of Hungary could even be\\nlocated, not to say murdered, without the full collaboration of\\nKastner and his few friends. No doubt the SS would hunt a few Jews\\nhere and there, but the scale of the operation would have been\\nminiscule compared to the half million who died in Auschwitz.\\n\\nIt is important to realise that Kastner was not an aberration,\\nlike say Rumkovsky in Lodz. Kastner acted as a result of his\\nstrongly held Zionist convictions. His actions were a logical\\noutcome of earlier positions. This is instanced when he exposed to\\nthe Gestapo the existence of a British cell of saboteurs, Palgi\\nand Senesh, and persuaded them to give themselves up, so as not to\\ndisrupt his operations. At no point during his trial or elsewhere,\\ndid Kastner deny that he knew exactly what was to happen to those\\nJews.',\n",

This directory can be used for things like\\narticles by Kates, Wright, Tonso, Levinson, Supreme Court Decisions,\\nthe RIA vs US decision, copies of legislation, and so on.  It\\'s not\\nmeant to be for the discussions that normally appear here.\\n\\nSo, in the future if you\\'re looking for something check there first\\nand then ask here.\\n\\nInstructions:\\n\\nShort version for techies:\\n\\nThe site is godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu.  Place contributions into the\\ndirectory /usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/rkba.  The ftp commands\\nget, put, mget, or mput should work.  Give the command \"type binary\"\\nto be sure files are transferred correctly.  Your files will be moved\\nto the rkba directory.  To get a file use the commands get or mget.\\n\\nI will maintain an index which you should get first to check if\\nthe file you want to read or write already is archived.\\n\\nLong version for non-techies:\\n\\nIn order for you to use this archive your computer must be on\\nthe Internet.  To connect to the archive site run the command:\\n\\n\\tftp godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu\\n\\nIf that doesn\\'t work you cannot use this archive.  If the ftp\\ncommand is successful you\\'ll get this prompt asking you for a\\nlogin:\\n\\tName (godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu:lvc):\\n\\nInstead of lvc your initials will appear.  Answer this prompt with:\\n\\n\\tftp\\n\\nNext you\\'ll get this prompt asking your for your e-mail address:\\n\\n\\tGuest login ok, send e-mail address as password:\\n\\nI would enter:\\n\\n\\tl.v.cipriani@att.com\\n\\nYou\\'ll enter your own e-mail address.  You\\'ll get these lines\\nor similar as output:\\n\\n\\tRemote system is UNIX.\\n\\tUsing binary mode to transfer files.\\n\\nNext, the command prompt is printed:\\n\\n\\tftp> \\n\\nIf you do not get the line \"Using binary mode to transfer files.\"\\nRun the command:\\n\\n\\ttype binary\\n\\nNow you\\'re logged in to the archive machine.  There are many\\ndirectories on this machine  but the two you are concerned with are\\n\\n\\t/usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/rkba\\nand\\n\\t/usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/incoming\\n\\nThere are subdirectories to the rkba directory, those are discussed below.\\n\\nWhen you login to the system your directory is /usr0/anon.  To retreive\\nfiles change your current directory to the rkba directory with the command:\\n\\n\\tcd /usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/rkba\\nor\\n\\tcd pub/firearms/politics/rkba\\n\\nTo submit files change your directory to the incoming directory with\\nthe command:\\n\\n\\tcd /usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/incoming\\nor\\n\\tcd pub/firearms/politics/incoming\\n\\nOnce you do this you\\'ll get another ftp> prompt asking you to enter\\nanother command.\\n\\nTo find the names of the existing files in the directory you are\\nin run the command:\\n\\n\\tls -l\\n\\nThis will produce something like:\\n\\ntotal 6021\\n-r--r--r--  1 karl          6932 Jun 16  1992 DMN_Gratia_CCP\\n-r--r--r--  1 karl         69149 Apr  5 19:20 INDEX\\n-r--r--r--  1 karl         18965 Jun 16  1992 Knox_AW_lies\\n-r--r--r--  1 karl         10930 Apr 30  1992 S361\\n-r--r--r--  1 karl          8958 Jun 16  1992 WSJ_Crimestrike\\n-r--r--r--  1 karl          2649 Jan 13 18:33 academia-bias\\n-r--r--r--  1 karl           935 Mar 22 22:38 academics\\n-r--r--r--  1 karl         36079 Aug  4  1992 aclu\\n... and so on ...\\n\\nEach line corresponds to one file.  Reading right to left, the fields\\nare the file name, the last modification date of the file, the size of\\nthe file in bytes, and some permission fields which you do not need\\nto be concerned with.\\n\\nTo get a file run the command \"get\" followed by the name of the file\\nyou want, for example:\\n\\n\\tget INDEX\\nor\\n\\tget noduty\\n\\nAfter the file is transfered to your machine a message like this:\\n\\n\\tTransfer complete.\\n\\t19580 bytes received in 5 seconds (4 Kbytes/s)\\n\\nYou can repeat the get command for every file you want to retreive.\\nYou can use the mget command to retreive multiple files.  If the\\nfile you want is in a subdirectory, for example, congress/103rd/HR1025\\nyou should change your directory to the appropriate subdirectory first\\nand then retrieve it:\\n\\n\\tcd congress/103rd\\n\\tget HR1025\\n\\nOnce you\\'re finished you can log off with the command:\\n\\n\\tquit\\n\\nIf you have a file you want to contribute the procedure is a little\\ndifferent.  First of all you should find out if the file already\\nexists, so get a copy of the index file with the procedure above\\nand look it over to make sure you wouldn\\'t repeat an entry.  The\\nindex will have a description of each of the files in the rkba\\ndirectory.  For example:\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nFile: whitemanslaw\\n\\nWhite Man\\'s Law by William R. Tonso, from the December 1985\\nReason magazine\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOnce you\\'ve determined you won\\'t be duplicating an entry, login\\nand change to the incoming directory command (see above).  Once\\nyou are in the incoming directory use the command:\\n\\n\\tput file_name\\n\\nIn this case:\\n\\n\\tput whitemanslaw\\n\\nAgain there\\'ll be a \"Transfer complete, so many bytes transfered\\nin so many seconds\" message.  Now your file is on the archive\\nmachine.\\n\\nAnother thing to watch out for is duplicate file /names/.  Be sure\\nthere isn\\'t a file in the incoming directory that is called the same\\nas the file you want to write.  If you use the same name you\\'ll\\noverwrite the previous file [or you\\'ll get an error message].\\n\\nYour file may have to be renamed if there is a conflict with a\\nfile by the same name in the rkba directory.\\n\\nOnce your file is in the incoming directory send me an entry for\\nthe INDEX file and I will add it to the file.\\n\\nIf you cannot use anonymous ftp and would still like to contribute\\na file email the file to me and I\\'ll take care of the rest.\\n\\nIf you submit a file and do not notify me it may be removed, so\\nbe sure to let me know first.\\n\\nIf you have any questions feel free to ask me.\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n-- \\nLarry Cipriani -- l.v.cipriani@att.com\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

The people of \\nTurkiye know quite well that Greece and the Greek Cypriots will never \\nabandon the idea of hellenizing Cyprus and will remain eternally \\nhopeful of uniting it with Greece, someday, whatever the cost to the\\nparties involved. The history speaks for itself. Greece was the sole \\nperpetrator of invasion on that island when it sent its troops on July \\n15, 1974 in an attempt to topple the legitimate government of Archibishop \\nMakarios.\\n\\nFollowing the Greek Cypriot attempt to annex the island to Greece with \\nthe aid of the Greek army, Turkiye intervened by using her legal right \\ngiven by two international agreements. Turkiye did it for the frequently \\nand conveniently forgotten people of the island, Turkish Cypriots. For \\nthose Turkish Cypriots whose grandparents have been living on the island \\nsince 1571. \\n\\nThe release of Nikos Sampson, a member of EOKA [National Organization\\nof Cypriot Fighters] and a convicted terrorist, shows that the\\n\\'enosis\\' mentality continues to survive in Greece.

Dr.  Nihat Ilhan happened to  be on duty that  night, the\\n24th   December  1963.

The onslaught  of the\\nGreeks against the Turks, which  started three days ago, has been\\ngoing on  with all its  ferocity; and defenseless women,  old men\\nand children are being brutally  killed by Greeks. And now Kumsal\\nArea of Nicosia witnesses the  worst example of the Greeks savage\\nbloodshed...\\n\\nThe wife  and the  three infant  children of  Dr. Nihat  Ilhan, a\\nmajor on duty at the camp  of the Cyprus Turkish Army Contingent,\\nare  mercilessly and  dastardly  shot dead  while  hiding in  the\\nbathroom of their house, by  maddened Greeks who broke into their\\nhome. A glaring example of Greek barbarism.\\n\\nLet us  now listen to the  relating of the said  incident told by\\nMr. Hasan  Yusuf Gudum, an  eye witness, who himself  was wounded\\nduring the same terrible event.\\n\\n\"On the night of the 24th  of December, 1963 my wife Feride Hasan\\nand I were paying a visit to the family of Major Dr. Nihat Ilhan.\\nOur neighbours  Mrs. Ayshe of  Mora, her daughter Ishin  and Mrs.\\nAyshe\\'s  sister Novber  were also  with us.  We were  all sitting\\nhaving supper.  All of  a sudden bullets  from the  Pedieos River\\ndirection started to riddle the  house, sounding like heavy rain.\\nThinking  that   the  dining-room  where  we   were  sitting  was\\ndangerous, we  ran to  the bathroom and  toilet which  we thought\\nwould be  safer. Altogether we were  nine persons. We all  hid in\\nthe bathroom  except my wife  who took  refuge in the  toilet. We\\nwaited in fear. Mrs. Ilhan the wife of Major Doctor, was standing\\nin the bath with her three children Murat, Kutsi and Hakan in her\\narms. Suddenly with  a great noise we heard the  front door open.\\nGreeks had  come in and were  combing, every corner of  the house\\nwith  their machine  gun bullets.  During these  moments I  heard\\nvoices saying, in  Greek, \"You want Taksim eh!\"  and then bullets\\nstarted flying in the bathroom. Mrs. Ilhan and her three children\\nfell into  the bath. They were  shot. At this moment  the Greeks,\\nwho broke  into the bathroom, emptied  their guns on us  again. I\\nheard one of the Major\\'s children moan, then I fainted.\\n\\nWhen I came  to myself 2 or  3 hours later, I saw  Mrs. Ilhan and\\nher three children lying dead in the  bath. I and the rest of the\\nneighbours in the  bathroom were all seriously  wounded. But what\\nhad happened to my wife? Then I remembered and immediately ran to\\nthe  toilet, where,  in  the doorway,  I saw  her  body. She  was\\nbrutally murdered.\\n\\nIn the  street admist the  sound of  shots I heard  voices crying\\n\"Help, help. Is  there no one to save us?\"  I became terrified. I\\nthought that  if the Greeks came  again and found that  I was not\\ndead they would kill  me. So I ran to the  bedroom and hid myself\\nunder the double-bed.\\n\\nAn our  passed by. In the  distance I could still  hear shots. My\\nmouth was dry,  so I came out  from under the bed  and drank some\\nwater. Then I put  some sweets in my pocket and  went back to the\\nbathroom, which was exactly as I had left in an hour ago. There I\\noffered sweets  to Mrs. Ayshe,  her daughter and Mrs.  Novber who\\nwere all wounded.\\n\\nWe  waited in  the bathroom  until 5  o\\'clock in  the morning.  I\\nthought morning would never come.  We were all wounded and needed\\nto be taken  to hospital. Finally, as we could  walk, Mrs. Novber\\nand I, went  out into the street hoping to  find help, and walked\\nas far as Koshklu Chiftlik.\\n\\nThere, we met  some people who took us to  hospital where we were\\noperated on. When  I regained my consciousness I  said that there\\nwere more  wounded in the  house and  they went and  brought Mrs.\\nAyshe and her daughter.\\n\\nAfter staying three  days in the hospital I was  sent by plane to\\nAnkara  for  further treatment.  There  I  have had  four  months\\ntreatment but still I cannot use  my arm. On my return to Cyprus,\\nGreeks arrested me at the Airport.\\n\\nAll  I have  related to  you above  I told  the Greeks  during my\\ndetention. They then released me.\"\\n\\nON FOOT INTO CYPRUS\\'S DEVASTATED TURKISH QUARTER\\n\\nWe went tonight into the sealed-off Turkish quarter of Nicosia in\\nwhich 200  to 300 people have  been slaughtered in the  last five\\ndays.\\n\\nWe  were the  first  Western  reporters there,  and  we saw  some\\nterrible sights.\\n\\nIn the Kumsal quarter at No. 2, Irfan Bey Sokagi, we made our way\\ninto  a house  whose floors  were  covered with  broken glass.  A\\nchild\\'s bicycle lay in a corner.\\n\\nIn the  bathroom, looking  like a group  of waxworks,  were three\\nchildren piled on top of their murdered mother.\\n\\nIn a room next to it we glimpsed  the body of a woman shot in the\\nhead.\\n\\nThis, we  were told, was the  home of a Turkish  Army major whose\\nfamily had been killed by the mob in the first violence.\\n\\nToday was five days later, and still they lay there.\\n\\nRene MacCOLL and Daniel McGEACHIE, (From the \"DAILY EXPRESS\")\\n\\n\"...I saw in  a bathroom the bodies of a  mother and three infant\\nchildren murdered because their father was a Turkish Officer...\"\\n\\nMax CLOS, LE FIGARO 25-26 January, 1964\\n\\n\\n Peter Moorhead reporting from the village of Skyloura, Cyprus. \\n Date : 1 January, 1964. \\n\\n IL GIARNO (Italy)\\n \\n THEY ARE TURK-HUNTING, THEY WANT TO EXTERMINATE THEM.\\n\\n Discussions start in London; in Cyprus terror continues.

The\\nfirst is, I think that they knew very well that the children did not\\nhave gas masks while the adults did, so the children had no chance\\nbecause this gas was very -- she said it was not lethal, but it was\\nvery dangerous to the children and they could not have survived\\nwithout gas masks.  And on February 28th -- let's go back -- didn't\\nthose people have a right to practice their religion?\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  They were not just practicing their\\nreligion, they were -- the Treasury Department believed that they had\\nviolated federal laws, any number of them.\\n\\n     Q  What federal laws --\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Let me go back and answer -- I can't\\nanswer the question about the gas masks, except to tell you that the\\nwhole purpose of using the tear gas was that it had been tested; they\\nwere convinced that it wouldn't kill either a child or an adult but\\nit would force anybody that breathed it to run outside.  And one of\\nthe things that I've heard -- I don't want to get into the details of\\nthis because I don't know -- but one of the things that they were\\nspeculating about today was that the wind was blowing so fast that\\nthe windows might have been opened and some of the gas might have\\nescaped and that may be why it didn't have the desired effect.\\n\\n     They also knew, Sarah, that there was an underground\\ncompound -- a bus buried underground where the children could be\\nsent.  And they were -- I think they were hoping very much that if\\nthe children were not released immediately outside that the humane\\nthing would be done and that the children would be sent someplace\\nwhere they could be protected.\\n\\n     In terms of the gas masks themselves, I learned\\nyesterday -- I did not ask this fact question before -- that the gas\\nwas supposed to stay active in the compound longer than the gas masks\\nthemselves were to work.  So that it was thought that even if they\\nall had gas masks, that eventually the gas would force them out in a\\nnonviolent, nonshooting circumstance.\\n\\n     MS. MYERS:  Last question.\\n\\n     Q  Mr. President, why are you still saying that --\\n\\n     Q  Could you tell us whether or not you ever asked\\nJanet Reno about the possibility of a mass suicide?  And when you\\nlearned about the actual fire and explosion what went through your\\nmind during those horrendous moments?\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  What I asked Janet Reno is if they had\\nconsidered all the worse things that could happen.  And she said --\\nand, of course, the whole issue of suicide had been raised in the\\npublic -- he had -- that had been debated anyway.  And she said that\\nthe people who were most knowledgeable  about these kinds of issues\\nconcluded that there was no greater risk of that now than there would\\nbe tomorrow or the next day or the day after that or at anytime in\\nthe future.  That was the judgment they made.  Whether they were\\nright or wrong, of course, we will never know.\\n\\n     What happened when I saw the fire, when I saw the\\nbuilding burning?  I was sick.  I felt terrible.  And my immediate\\nconcern was whether the children had gotten out and whether they were\\nescaping or whether they were inside, trying to burn themselves up.\\nThat's the first thing I wanted to know.\\n\\n     Thank you.\\n\\n     Q  Mr. President, why are you still saying it was a\\nJanet Reno decision?  Isn't it, in the end, your decision?\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, what I'm saying is that I didn't\\nhave a four- or five-hour, detailed briefing from the FBI.  I didn't\\ngo over every strategic part of it.  It is a decision for which I\\ntake responsibility.  I'm the President of the United States and I\\nsigned off on the general decision and giving her the authority to\\nmake the last call.  When I talked to her on Sunday, some time had\\nelapsed.

       " 'This was posted to the firearms-politics mailing list.\\n==============================================================\\nHi Folks;\\n\\nWednesday marked day 2, the beginning of the trial.  Opening\\nstatements were given by both the prosecution and the defense,\\neach side presenting its version of what happenned last August.\\n\\nThe prosecution argued that Weaver and his family moved to\\nIdaho in 1983 anticipating a battle with the \"evil\" federal\\ngovernment.  The prosecution alleges that Weaver sold federal\\nagents \"sawed off\" shotguns and later failed to appear for\\ntrial: Despite repeated \"good faith\" efforts to get Weaver\\nto surrender peacefully, Weaver refused.  The shootout erupted\\nwhen Weaver discovered agents on a surveillance mission and\\nbegan firing.  According to the prosecution, three people\\nwere taking an \"offensive action\" against an FBI helicopter\\nwhen an FBI sniper killed Vicki Weaver.\\n\\nThe defense argued that Weaver and his family moved to northern\\nIdaho in 1983 to practice their religion in peace.  They wanted\\nsimply to be left alone.  Weaver was induced by federal agents to\\nsell the short-barrelled shotgun (and did not, as the prosecution\\nalleged, want to become a \"regular supplier\").  The defense also\\nargued that the federal government sought to arrest Weaver when\\nhe wouldn\\'t become an informant [it is not specified explicitly,\\nbut I assume that this is a reference to the white separatist\\nangle of the story.  We\\'ll know more as things develop].  The\\nfailure to appear in court happenned because Weaver was given\\nan incorrect court date and then indicted before that date.\\nThe shootout occurred when federal agent Arthur Roderick killed\\nWeaver\\'s dog that was in proximity to Weaver\\'s son, Samuel.  Weaver\\nthen fired in self-defense.  In the ensuing battle, federal\\nagent William Degan was killed (when his gun was later found,\\nthere were 7 .223 cases nearby and the gun was on semi-automatic:\\nHowever, agents were near the body for an extended period of\\ntime and could have played with the select-fire - this will\\nhave to be more fully explained).  Finally, the defense claims\\nthat Vicki Weaver was only going to \"look at the body\" [not recover?]\\nof her son when she was cut-down by an FBI sniper.\\n\\nProsecution quote: \"Weaver wanted that confrontation, and he made\\nthat confrontation.\" -- Asst. U.S. Attorney Kim Lindquist\\n\\nDefense quote: \"The evidence in this case is going to show that\\nthis is a case where Randy Weaver and Kevin Harris are charged\\nwith crimes they didn\\'t commit in order to cover crimes that\\nthe government did commit.\"  -- Gerry Spence  [nice soundbite!]\\n\\nNotes: The _Idaho Statesman_ claims that Weaver supporters\\nheeded a call from Spence not to repeat yesterday\\'s protests\\noutside the courthouse.  However, the local NBC affiliate\\nagain had footage on the 10:00 news with 5 supporters including\\n\"Tim\" again.  \"Tim\" claimed he was a skinhead, who were \"ordinary,\\nworking class people.\"  He also claimed he was for \"white pride,\\nnot white power.\"\\n\\nOutside the courthouse the television crew had an impromptu interview\\nwith Bo Gritz, who charged that the neo-nazi protestors are exactly\\nwhat the government wants to smear Randy Weaver.\\n\\nIn an affiliated article carried in the _Idaho Statesman_, about\\na dozen lawyers were among the 70 or so people packed into the\\ncourthouse.  These lawyers were present to watch Gerry Spence\\nin action, and to perhaps learn something from him.  Some\\ntidbits: Spence flatly told the jurors that he and his son Kent\\nwere volunteering their time to represent Weaver because they\\nbelieved in him.  Spence, during his 90-minute opening statement,\\nrepeatedly walked behind Weaver and placed his hands on the\\ndefendants shoulders (Weaver broke down and cried during the\\nrecounting of his wife\\'s death), and Spence compared the \"sawed\\noff\" shotgun to driving 56 mph when the limit was 55 (another\\ngood one!).\\n\\nToday (Thursday, April 15th) the prosecution was scheduled to\\nbegin presenting evidence.\\n\\nDrew\\n=============================================================\\n\\n',\n",

We ran into one of my relatives at the \\nbus station and got to talking. A lot of people had gathered not far away,\\nnear the store. Well at first we didn\\'t know what was happening, and then a\\nfellow I know comes up to me, an Azerbaijani guy, and says, \"What are you\\nstanding here for? Go home immediately!\" I asked, \"What\\'s going on?\" He says, \\n\"What\\'s the matter, can\\'t you see, they\\'ve overturned a car and they\\'re \\nkilling Armenians!\" He helped me catch a cab and we got home safely.\\n\\nWe sat at home for two days. During that time a gang of bandits came into our \\ncourtyard. But the neighbors wouldn\\'t let them in the building. There were \\nabout 80 of them. They had sticks and pieces of armatures in their hands. They\\nwere shouting something, but you couldn\\'t understand it. It wasn\\'t one voice \\nor two, all of them were shouting in a chorus. They turned toward Building 35.\\nThey went up to the third _floor, and we see that they\\'re breaking glass and \\nthrowing things out the window. After a while they come out the entryway: one \\nhas a pair of jeans in his hands, another has a tape recorder, and a third a \\nguitar. They went on toward the auto parts store.\\n\\nWe had to save ourselves. After midnight on March 1 we went to hide at School \\nNo. 33, which is in Microdistrict 13. There were two other Armenian families \\nthere with us. There were 13 of us altogether. Out of all of them I had only \\nknown Ernest before, he had moved to Sumgait from Kirovabad. The Azerbaijani \\nguard at the school let us in. At first he didn\\'t want to, but there was \\nnowhere else for us to go. We had to plead with him and talk him into it. We \\nwere told that on that day, the 1st, there would be an attack on our \\nmicrodistrict.\\n\\nWe went upstairs to a classroom on the second floor.\\n\\nOn the city radio station they announced three telephone numbers that could be\\nused to summon assistance or communicate anything important. I called one of \\nthem and the First Secretary of the Sumgait City Party Committee answered. I\\nasked him for assistance. I say, \"We\\'re in School No. 33, we need to be \\nevacuated.\" Well he says, \"Got it, wait there, I\\'m sending out help now.\"\\n\\nI know his voice. The First Secretary had been to our plant, I had spoken with\\nhim personally. When I called he said, \"Muslimzade here.\"\\n\\nAbout two hours after the call we heard shouts near the school. We looked out\\nthe window and about 100 to 120 people were outside saying, \"Armenians, come \\nout, we\\'re here to get you.\" They have clubs, axes, and armature shafts in \\ntheir hands. The guard sat there with us, and asked, \"Where should I go?\" I \\nsay, \"If your life is of any value to you you\\'ll go down there and say that \\nthe Armenians were here and that they left.\" That\\'s what he did. He went down \\nthere and said, \"The Armenians were here,\" he said, \"I let them out the back \\ndoor, they went that way.\" And pointed with his hand. And with shouts and \\nnoise the mob set off in the direction he had pointed.\\n\\nSo the assistance we had been promised did come. They sent us help, all right!\\nInstead of sending real soldiers he had sent his own. I am positive that\\nMuslimzade did that. No one had seen us entering the school, no one knew that \\nwe were there. In any case, we stayed at the school until seven in the \\nmorning, and no soldiers of any sort came to our aid.\\n\\nIn the morning we went to my relative\\'s in Microdistrict 1, and the soldiers \\ntook us to the SK club from there. The club was jammed with people, and there \\nwere lots of people ahead of us--there was no space available. One small boy, \\nabout three months old, died right in my arms. There wasn\\'t a single doctor, \\nnothing. The boy was uninjured, there were no wounds or bruises on him. He was\\njust very ill. They gave him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, they did everything\\nthey could under the circumstances, but were unable to save him. And his \\nmother and father, a young Armenian couple, were right there, on the floor ...\\n\\nI searched for a spot for us in the SK, we have a small child of our own, I\\nwanted to find a room or something to put my family in. I went up to the third\\nfloor, there were a lot of soldiers up there, bandaged, with canes, limping, \\nwith their heads broken open. They were a terrible sight. Young guys, all of \\nthem.\\n\\nThere were a lot of bandaged Armenians, too. Everyone had been beaten, \\neveryone was crying, wailing, and calling for help. I think that the City\\nParty Committee ignored us completely. True, there was a snack bar: a sausage \\nwas 30 kopeks or 40 kopeks, a package of cookies that cost 26 kopeks was being\\nsold for 50, a bottled soft drink cost a ruble . . . But there was no way to \\nget the things any cheaper.\\n\\nI met my old uncle, Aram Mikhailovich, there. He saw me and tears welled up in\\nhis eyes. My whole life he had told me that we were friendly peoples, that we \\nworked together, he always had Azerbaijanis over at his house. And now he saw \\nme and there was nothing he could say, he just cried.

There are maybe 6-10 teeth (dogs) on the side of the\\ngears that engage the next gear over as the forks slide the gears back\\nand forth.  To shift:  start to apply pressure at the same time the\\nclutch is pulled (the clutch is a hand lever) and shift quickly.  If \\nyou try a slow lazy shift it will grind, you just have to pop it into\\nthe next gear before it has a chance to grind.  There isn\\'t a neutral\\nbetween gears (obviously there is, but you can\\'t select it with the\\nshifter) so double clutching is not a possibility.  \"speed shifting\"\\n(which is what I have always heard \"clutchless shifting\" called) works\\npretty well for upshifts with some practice, but I usually use the\\nclutch-especially for the lower gears.\\n\\nI think auto (as in automobile) trannys are similar, except that the\\nengagment dogs are very fine, with no slop.

Security Council Resolution 713 of \\n  September 25, 1991, the United Nations has been actively \\n  addressing the crisis in the former Yugoslavia.  The Security \\n  Council acted in Resolution 781 to establish a ban on all \\n  unauthorized military flights over Bosnia-Herzegovina.  There \\n  have, however, been blatant violations of the ban, and villages \\n  in Bosnia have been bombed.\\n  \\n  In response to these violations, the Security Council decided, \\n  in Resolution 816 of March 31, 1993, to extend the ban to all \\n  unauthorized flights over Bosnia-Herzegovina and to authorize \\n  Member States, acting nationally or through regional organi-\\n  zations, to take all necessary measures to ensure compliance.  \\n  NATO's North Atlantic Council (NAC) agreed to provide NATO air \\n  enforcement for the no-fly zone.  The U.N. Secretary General \\n  was notified of NATO's decision to proceed with Operation DENY \\n  FLIGHT, and an activation order was delivered to participating \\n  allies.\\n  \\n  The United States actively supported these decisions.  At my \\n  direction, the Joint Chiefs of Staff sent an execute order to \\n  all U.S. forces participating in the NATO force, for the conduct \\n  of phased air operations to prevent flights not authorized by \\n  the United Nations over Bosnia-Herzegovina.  The U.S. forces \\n  initially assigned to this operation consist of 13 F-15 and \\n  12 F-18A fighter aircraft and supporting tanker aircraft.  \\n  These aircraft commenced enforcement operations at 8:00 a.m. \\n  e.d.t. on April 12, 1993.  The fighter aircraft are equipped for \\n  combat to accomplish their mission and for self-defense.\\n  \\n  NATO has positioned forces and has established combat air \\n  patrol (CAP) stations within the control of Airborne Early \\n  Warning (AEW) aircraft.  The U.S. CAP aircraft will normally \\n  operate from bases in Italy and from an aircraft carrier in the \\n  Adriatic Sea.  Unauthorized aircraft entering or approaching \\n  the no-fly zone will be identified, interrogated, intercepted, \\n  escorted/monitored, and turned away (in that order).  If these \\n  steps do not result in compliance with the no-fly zone, such \\n  aircraft may be engaged on the basis of proper authorization by \\n  NATO military authorities and in accordance with the approved \\n  \\n                                more\\n  \\n       \\t    \\t      \\t   \\t     \\t       \\t    (OVER)\\n\\x0c\\n                                  2\\n  \\n  rules of engagement, although we do not expect such action will \\n  be necessary.  The Commander of UNPROFOR (the United Nations \\n  Protection Force currently operating in Bosnia-Herzegovina) was \\n  consulted to ensure that his concerns for his force were fully \\n  considered before the rules of engagement were approved.\\n  \\n  It is not possible to predict at this time how long such \\n  operations will be necessary.  I have directed U.S. armed forces \\n  to participate in these operations pursuant to my constitutional \\n  authority as Commander in Chief.  I am grateful for the con-\\n  tinuing support that the Congress has given to this effort, and \\n  I look forward to continued cooperation as we move forward \\n  toward attainment of our goals in this region.\\n  \\n       \\t    \\t      \\t   \\tSincerely,\\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n       \\t    \\t      \\t   \\tWILLIAM J.

Words *can be taken\\nback* by merely doing so; to \"take back\" tangible items (land,\\ncontrol of land) requires the sort of action you say Israel should\\nstay away from.\\n \\nIsrael put up with attacks from Arab state territories for decades \\nbefore essentially putting a stop to it through its invasion of Lebanon.\\nThe entire basis of that reality was exactly as you state above: 1) Israel \\nwould express outrage at these attacks and protest to the Arab state \\ninvolved, 2) that state promptly ignored the entire matter, secure \\nin the knowledge that IT could not be held responsible for the acts \\ncommitted by \"private groups\", 3) Israel would prepare for the next \\nround of attacks. What would Israel want to return to those days (and\\ndon\\'t be so idiotic as to suggest \"trust\" for the motivations of\\npresent-day Arab states)?\\n\\nAh, ok...what is \"different\" about the present situation that tells\\nus that the Arab states will *not* pursue their past antagonistic \\npolicies towards Israel? Now, don\\'t talk about vague \"political factors\"\\nbut about those \"tangible\" (just like that which Israel gave up)\\nfactors that \"guarantee\" the responsibility of those states. Your\\nassessment of \"difference\" here is based on a whole lot of assumptions,\\nand most states don\\'t feel confortable basing their existence on that\\nsort of thing.\\n\\n\\nIt has not.

The context of the \\nconversation was that President Clinton was actually reassuring \\nPresident Yeltsin at the time about his conversations with Prime \\nMinister Miyazawa over the Kuril Islands and the Prime Minister\\'s \\nbelief that Japan would play a constructive role in the G-7 process.  \\nI mean this was a casual comment about Japanese courtesy and \\netiquette but overall it was in the context of a conversation where \\nhe was reassuring President Yeltsin that he believed the Japanese \\nwere serious about their commitment to the G-7 process.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t   Are you saying that the President said that when \\nthe Japanese say yes they mean no?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That\\'s not -- I don\\'t know the \\nexact words and there was a much longer discussion about he did say \\nsomething along the lines that he believes that on this issue Prime \\nMinister Miyazawa intends to really go forward with the G-7 process.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Have there been any attempts to explain this to the \\nJapanese because apparently the Japanese press has picked this up and \\nthere appears to be --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I\\'ve seen the reports in the \\nJapanese press and it actually does put the situation in context.  It \\ndoes talk about the Japanese -- understanding the Japanese points of \\nview.  I don\\'t think it\\'s going to be a problem.  I believe that \\nthere may have been some diplomatic context just to clear things up \\nbut I\\'m not positive.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, was the specific comment that was made \\nspecific to the Kuril Island situation or was it a general \\nobservation on Japanese etiquette?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The discussion was about --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  The specific comment is what I\\'m asking about that \\nhas alleged to have been translated from the Russian notes, \"when the \\nJapanese say yes they mean no.\"\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, it was a combination.  I mean \\nI don\\'t think that\\'s the whole sentence.  I think that the specific \\ncomment was a broad, general observation followed up by a specific \\nfinish to the sentence where he said in this case he believes that \\nPrime Minister Miyazawa means to keep the commitment.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Was he saying it facetiously first?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think it was just a casual \\nobservation.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  And then you say diplomatic contacts were made to \\nclear it up.  Has the President sent a message?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, I don\\'t think the President \\nspoke; I believe that Secretary Christopher has made some calls but \\nI\\'m not sure exactly how many.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Well, this obviously is a bigger deal than you\\'re \\nmaking it out to be if Christopher has had to make some calls.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, no.  It was just that we got \\nthe reports in Vancouver and the Secretary wanted to make sure that \\nit was understood and make sure there was absolutely no \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  -- reports in Vancouver, and the \\nSecretary wanted to make sure that it was understood, and make sure \\nthere is absolutely no misunderstanding, and I don\\'t believe there is \\non.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What is our position about the Japanese?  That they \\nmay have to say one thing, but actualy mean another?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.  The position on the Japanese \\nis as the President stated to President Yeltsin throughout the two \\ndays.  He said that he had had a good conversation with Prime \\nMinister Miazawa prior to the Summit.  He reiterated the U.S. \\nposition, the long-standing support for the Japanese position on the \\nKuril Islands, but also reiterated Prime Minister Miazawa\\'s \\ncommitment to move forward on the G-7 process and to play a \\nconstructive role.  And I think President Yeltsin was very glad to \\nhear that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  After listening to Secretary Christopher on Iraq \\nfor the last few days, I\\'m a little confused.  What is the U.S. \\npolicy?  Do you want to see Saddam Hussein overturned?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It\\'s the same policy that Secretary \\nChristopher has reiterated, and all of the U.S officials have \\nreiterated.  We expect full and complete and unequivocal compliance \\nwith all U.N. resolutions.  Right now we do not have that compliance.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     throwing it out further that if Iraq complies, \\nSaddam can\\'t stay in office?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Right.  I think that that\\'s -- our \\njudgment is that it is not possible for Saddam Hussein to comply with \\nthe resolutions and stay in power.  But the important point is that \\nwe expect compliance by Iraq with all U.N. resolutions, and we will \\ncontinue to demand it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  And are you concerned the Iran will become the \\ndominant power in the area --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Secretary Christopher has also \\nspoken to Iran over the last several days, and he says we also expect \\nfull Iranian compliance with all international norms, and stopping \\nsupport of terrorism.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  That\\'s a very glib statement that he won\\'t stay in \\npower if he complies with U.N. resolutions.  On what logic do you \\nbase that?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Right now Saddam Hussein is not \\ncomplying with the U.N. resolutions at all.  He is not respecting the \\nrights of his people, as is required by the U.N. resolution.  He is \\nnot fully complying with all the resolutions regarding inspections.  \\nHe is not fully complying with all the resolutions regarding \\narmaments.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Well, when do you think that if he did comply he \\nwould be out of power?\\n\\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, right now his power rests on \\nthe repression of his people.  If he stopped doing that it would make \\nit more difficult for him to stay in power.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, back on the stimulus package, why is it \\nthat you and the President accuse the Republicans of playing pure \\npolitics and perpetuating gridlock?  Why is it that -- what evidence \\ndo you have that they just don\\'t have a genuine idealogical \\ndifference with you that\\'s in good faith?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the fact that several times \\nin the past the Republicans, many of the ones who are now leading the \\nfight for the filibuster, have supported the very funding they now \\nseek to stop, most especially, the highway funding.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, in regards to that, some of the moderate \\nRepublicans said that the White House erred by not being more open to \\nthem during the -- while the plan was put together, that they had \\none, sort of, proforma meeting between the White House and the Senate \\nRepublicans, and that was it.  Does the Administration look back and \\nthinks perhaps it could have done a better job of working with some -\\n-\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I\\'m not sure that it\\'s true \\nthat there was only one meeting.  I mean, the President met with the \\nRepublican leadership on at least two occasions before the \\nintroduction of his package.  He met with the entire Senate \\nRepublican Caucus also for lunch, and went up there.  We are \\ncontinually in contact with as many Republicans as we can find who \\nhave an interest in the President\\'s package.  We are interested in \\nwhat they have to say, as well.  But we believe that this program is \\nimportant, and we\\'re going to continue to fight for it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     your all or nothing, do it with the Democrats \\nalone strategy, did you maybe miscalculate the ability to get it \\nthrough?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I mean, I think that there is \\nno question that under the Senate rules a determined minority can \\nfrustrate activity.  I mean, there is just no question about that.  \\nYou only need 40 plus one to keep going.  40 plus one to keep going \\nand to stop any action, and that\\'s what the Republicans are doing.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     going to rethink the way you attempt to get \\nother things passed as you go through this process for the rest of \\nthe summer?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     work with Republicans and try to woo some \\nRepublicans into your camp?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think we\\'re going to continue to \\nlook for the support of Republicans whenever we can get it on the \\nPresident\\'s intiatives?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  But on this one -- how are you going to do it \\ndifferently than you did it on this one because on this one you \\nreally did stiff the Republicans from the beginning and made it clear \\nthat it was a Democratic majority that would get this through and \\ncould get it through and you really didn\\'t need Republican votes?  \\nAre you going to take a different tack when you have to go for \\nparticular votes?  When you have to go through --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I can\\'t see into the future and \\nunderstand every possible turn in the legislative road.  Clearly the \\nPresident\\'s going to continue to reach out when he can.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  You don\\'t have any regrets then about the way you \\nhave handled it up to now and you don\\'t plan any changes in your \\napproach in dealing with the Republicans in Congress based on this \\nexperience?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Obviously the President would like \\nhis package passed as quickly as possible and he\\'s going to continue \\nto press for that.  We will continue to reach out to Republicans, \\nthere\\'s not question about that.  And we\\'ll continue to reason with \\nthem and try and find appropriate avenues for cooperation.  In this \\ncase the Republicans have chosen to unify around a filibuster, around \\na plan to frustrate action not a plan to move forward.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  They\\'re being denied any other legislative means of \\nputting their proposals forward.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think they\\'re being --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     any ideas.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think their amendments are being \\ndefeated; I don\\'t know that they\\'re being denied.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     to present them.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That\\'s not exactly true.  I mean \\nthey get the votes --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     that theirs can be passed though by the \\nparliamentary rules under which they\\'re playing.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Unless they get a majority in \\nsupport all the way around, no, that\\'s not exactly true.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, one more on Iraq.  Is the administration \\nbacking any of the Iraqi opposition?  Grooming any new leadership?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     backing any of the Iraqi -- leadership?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, I -- again, we\\'re pressing for \\nIraqi compliance.  I don\\'t know if we can get into the business of \\ngrooming leadership.  I believe there have been some contacts, at \\nsome levels, with Iraqi opposition groups.  I don\\'t know  about \\nanything recently.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     Jesse Jackson, who, of course, is not the \\nPresident\\'s best friend, has, however, been told that there is to be \\nsome kind of town meeting, or some kind of involvement by the \\nPresident, pre-empted the ball game -- Los Angeles.  Will he consider \\nsomething like that, or any other kind of intervention there?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, as you know, the President \\nappointed Commerce Secretary Ron Brown, about 10 days ago, to be a \\nspecial envoy to California, and coordiante cabinet activities around \\nthe California economic situation, including the situation in Los \\nAngeles.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I believe there will also be visits out to Los Angeles \\nby the Education -- or have been visits by the Education Secretary, \\nMr. Riley.  I believe that Transportation Secretary Pena and HUD \\nSecretary Cisneros are also going out.  And there may be other visits \\nby Cabinet officials over the next several days and weeks.  I \\nwouldn\\'t rule out the possibility of a visit by President Clinton to \\nCalifornia.  Obviously, he is following the situation closely, and is \\nconcerned about making sure that we make the right long term policy \\ndecisions that will help create the kind of economic opportunities \\nwhich help prevent disturbances.  But we\\'re going to continue to \\nwatch it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, as a follow-up, Reverend Jackson is also \\nsupposed to be outside the ball park today, in Baltimore, with a \\ngroup of supporters protesting the lack of minorities in baseball \\nmanagement.  Does the President have a position on that?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has received \\ncorrespondence from Reverend Jackson.  I know that Reverend Jackson \\nhas also spoken with the White House Chief of Staff, Mack McLarty.  \\nHe clearly raises serious questions.  There has been some progress in \\nbaseball over the last several years, but still not enough.  But the \\nPresident intends to continue to go to the ball game.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is he going to say anything about it today, or see \\nReverend Jackson while he\\'s out there?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t know if he is going to see \\nthem, but as I said, the President believes that Reverend Jackson has \\nraised some serious questions, and it\\'s something that, as I said, \\neven though there has been progress, it\\'s clearly not enough.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Did Reverend Jackson ask him not to go to the ball \\ngame?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I\\'m not sure about that.  I believe \\nthe characterization the Reverend Jackson is talking about is an \\ninformational pickett.  I don\\'t know that he asked him not to go to \\nthe ball game, but he sent a long, detailed, formal letter outlining \\nhis concerns with the situation in major league baseball and the \\nPresident read it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, the Orioles are playing the Rangers, the \\nmanaging partner of the Rangers is George W. Bush.  Is he going to be \\nthere, and is he going to meet with the President?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don\\'t know.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What is the Mubarak schedule?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I know that President Mubarak is \\ncoming tomorrow morning for a working meeting, they will have a \\nlunch, and I believe that he is having dinner tonight with Vice \\nPresident Gore.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  And joint statements tomorrow --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I believe so, yes.  At the end, \\nyes.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is there evidence, George, that the Egyptians did \\nwarn the U.S. about a potential terrorist bombing -- terrorist \\nactivities?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As reported in The New York Times, \\nI mean, I think that President Mubarak did say that there has been \\ngeneral conversations with the Egyptians, as there have been for a \\nlong period of time.  We do have general intelligence sharing, I \\nmean.  But President Mubarak was very careful to point out that there \\nwas no specific information on this visit that was passed forward.  \\nThe President will continue to investigate the situation, but he also \\nreiterates his belief that we cannot tolerate terrorism of any kind.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, he did make specific -- or the Egyptians, \\napparently, did issue specific warnings about this individual who, \\nforgive me --this individual who, forgive me the name escapes me at \\nthe moment, and said the Egyptians were more or less rebuffed in \\ntheir attempts to get some kind of action.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I don\\'t know if I would \\nagree with your characterization of the Mubarak interview.  He did \\nsay that they gave general warnings about the possibility of a \\nnetwork in the United States and upon which we took appropriate \\naction.  But there was no specific information on this specific \\noperation at all.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  So, the White House doesn\\'t feel that any of the \\nlaw enforcement agencies whether it be the CIA or FBI who would have \\nreceived this kind of information was lax or derelict in its duty in \\nnot pursuing some kind of --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, not at all.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What\\'s next with Serbia?  It got only a passing \\nmention in the news conference yesterday --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  You didn\\'t get to ask your \\nquestion.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Yes, exactly.  Was there any agreement on concerted \\naction between the two countries?  And even if there wasn\\'t, what \\ndoes the U.S. do next?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think the U.S. is clearly going \\nto move forward in the U.N. today continuing discussions with our \\nallies on a sanctions resolution and we\\'ll continue to look for ways \\nto press the Serbians to come to the negotiating table and sign an \\nagreement.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, why do you think sanctions is still an \\noption?  I mean the Serbians make it clear that at least the \\nleadership is surviving just fine and they feel like they can wait \\nyou out and even the administration officials we had in the other day \\nsaid there\\'s no evidence that they\\'re going to have an effect any \\ntime soon.  The Bosnian Serbs have said no to the peace plan.  When \\ndoes no mean no and you have to do something different?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I mean we are doing something \\ndifferent.  We\\'re moving forward on further sanctions through the \\nU.N. and those discussions will continue.  We\\'re going to continue to \\ntry and tighten the noose on Serbia, and I think that every \\nopportunity we have to do that will have an effect over time.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Are we looking again at lifting the arms embargo? \\nMR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has said that this is something \\nthat is under consideration.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, do you have any more on Hugh Rodham\\'s \\ncondition, how he\\'s doing?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As far as I know nothing\\'s changed.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, -- week after Mr. Mubarak?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It\\'s a little unclear.  I think \\nwe\\'ll be able to get you more either tonight or tomorrow morning \\nafter the Mubarak visit.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is he going somewhere for Easter?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not that I know of.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What more can you tell us about the additional aid \\nto Russia that the President plans to ask Congress about?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He\\'s going to be consulting with \\nthe Congress and with our G-7 partners over the next couple of weeks.  \\nI know that he spoke last evening with Congressman Gephardt and their \\ndelegation before the -- the congressional delegation meets with the \\nRussians this week and those consultations will continue over the \\nnext several weeks.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Do you expect that package to be of the magnitude \\nof the one announced Sunday?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I\\'m not going to discuss the \\nmagnitude.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  How about the list of Cold War restrictions, where \\ndo you stand on that --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As the President said yesterday, \\nhe\\'s going to be looking for that list from the Congress this week \\nand reviewing it.  He believes -- he\\'s going to try and get it this \\nweek and he\\'s going to review the list, and we\\'re going to take a \\nhard look at it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  But they\\'re making it up?  I mean it\\'s no White \\nHouse involvement, Congress is compiling this list?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think he\\'s going to talk to the \\ncongressional leaders about compiling the list but I\\'m certain we\\'ll \\nbe able to get our own researchers working as well.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, isn\\'t lifting the arms embargo more of a \\nprobability than a possibility?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It\\'s something that\\'s under \\ndiscussion.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Secretary Christopher has said that it\\'s a matter \\nof time and -- for months before that happens.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, all I can say is that it\\'s \\nsomething that the President is reviewing.  Right now we\\'re working \\nwith our allies in the U.N on a sanctions resolution, and we\\'ll \\ncontinue to review other matters.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  George, can you tell us anything about the schedule \\nthis week?  Any travel?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They just asked about that.  I \\ndon\\'t have anything more beyond tomorrow\\'s visit with Mubarak right \\nnow.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Are there consultations, George, with any Jewish \\nAmerican organizations concerning Jackson-Vanick?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As you know the National Conference \\nof Soviet Jewry has a list of, I believe, \\n\\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  -- as you know, the National \\nConference of Soviet Jewry has a list of, I believe, 200 Refuseniks.  \\nWe\\'ll certainly take a look at that and continue appropriate \\ndiscussions.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Thanks.\\n',\n",

There were literally thousands\\n  of incidents continuously until World War I, in Southeastern Europe as far\\n  west and north as Monastir and Kavalla, in Istanbul, at Gallipoli and\\n  the Dardanelles, at Salonica, and in all the Arab provinces as far south\\n  as Damascus and Beirut and in Egypt at Cairo and Alexandria. These\\n  invariably resulted from accusations spread among Ottoman Christians\\n  by word of mouth, or published in their newspapers, often by Christian\\n  financiers and merchants anxious to get their Jewish competitors out of\\n  the way or to divert onto the Jews Muslim anger at reports of Christian\\n  massacres of Muslims in Southeastern Europe or Central Asia, resulting\\n  in individual and mob attacks on Jews, and the burning of their shops\\n  and homes.\\n\\n  Individual experiences were horrible. Jews constantly went in fear of\\n  Armenian or Greek attacks in the streets of Ottoman cities. In Egypt\\n  and Syria, it was usually the Greeks who led the way, in many cases\\n  with the assistance of local Armenians and Syrian Christians, whose\\n  Greek, Arabic and French-language newspapers often printed all the\\n  rumors they could find regarding Jews, evidently with the desire of\\n  instigating violence. The Syrian Arab Christians in particular spread\\n  their long-standing anti-Semitic hatreds from Syria to Egypt, where\\n  their monopoly of the local press and their espousal of popular causes\\n  such as Egyptian nationalism and opposition to the British rule, enabled\\n  them to spread their anti-Jewish message among the Muslim masses with\\n  little question or opposition.\\n\\n  On 20 June 1890, thus, Sir Evelyn Baring (later Lord Cromer), British\\n  High Commissioner in Egypt, received the following report from David\\n  and Nissim Ades, in Cairo:\\n\\n    \\'\\'Sir,\\n\\n      I beg sir to draw to your attention to the violent articles which\\n      has (sic) appeared in an Arabic paper called El Mahroussa which\\n      contained nothing but lies and false accusations against the Jews,\\n      especially those (the issues) of the 14th, 17th and 19th instant.\\n      Now, Sir, are we to have here an anti-Semitic party amidst fanaticism,\\n      Greeks, Armenians, etc., or is he to be allowed to continue to poison\\n      the people\\'s minds with exaggeration and painted words?

       " 'Dennis Deconcini, 1982\\n \\n...In these and similar areas, the\\nBureau has violated not only the dictates of common sense, but of 5\\nU.S.C. Sec 552, which was intended to prevent \"secret lawmaking\" by\\nadministrative bodies.\\n   These practices, amply documented in hearings before this Sub-\\ncommittee, leave little doubt that the Bureau has disregarded\\nrights guaranteed by the constitution and laws of the United\\nStates.\\n   It has trampled upon the second amendment by chilling exercise\\nof the right to keep and bear arms by law-abiding citizens.\\n   It has offended the fourth amendment by unreasonably search-\\ning and seizing private property.\\n   It has ignored the Fifth Amendment by taking private property\\nwithout just compensation and by entrapping honest citizens with-\\nout regard for their right to due process of law.\\n   The rebuttal presented to the Subcommittee by the Bureau was\\nutterly unconvincing. Richard Davis, speaking on behalf of the\\nTreasury Department, asserted vaguely that the Bureau\\'s priorities\\nwere aimed at prosecuting willful violators, particularly felons ille-\\ngally in possession, and at confiscating only guns actually likely to\\nbe used in crime. He also asserted that the Bureau has recently\\nmade great strides toward achieving these priorities. No documen-\\ntation was offered for either of these assertions. In hearings before\\nBATF\\'s Appropriations Subcommittee, however, expert evidence\\nwas submitted establishing that approximately 75 percent of BATF\\ngun prosecutions were aimed at ordinary citizens who had neither\\ncriminal intent nor knowledge, but were enticed by agents into\\nunknowning technical violations.\\n \\n( Exerpt from: 97th Congress; 2d Session   COMMITTEE PRINT\\n     T H E   R I G H T   T O   K E E P   A N D   B E A R   A R M S\\n                                REPORT\\n                                of the\\n                   SUBCOMMITTEE ON THE CONSTITUTION\\n                                of the\\n                      COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY\\n                         UNITED STATES SENATE\\n                        NINETY-SEVENTH CONGRESS\\n                            SECOND SESSION\\n                             FEBRUARY, 1982\\n        Printed for the use of the Committee on the Judiciary\\n                    U.S. GOVERNMENT PRINTING OFFICE\\n88-618 O\\n                        WASHINGTON : 1982\\n \\n \\nLetter to Constituent: April 1993\\n \\n \\nThank you for contacting me regarding the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,\\nand Firearms (ATF), which is the Federal law enforcement agency with\\njurisdiction over firearms violations and regulations.\\n \\nIt has been my experience as chairman of the Appropriations\\nSubcommittee on Treasury, Postal Service and General Government which\\nfunds ATF, that ATF is one of the most competent and highly\\nprofessional law enforcement agencies in the Federal government.\\nThe agents of ATF have proven their value again and again in\\nsuccessful, legal operations to curb the unlawful possession and use\\nof firearms, especially in the area of  drug-related crimes.  It\\nenforces the Armed Career Criminal Act which calls for mandatory\\nminimum sentences for repeat felons using firearms to carry out  an\\nillegal activity.  The Bureau has made itself a key component in\\npreventing gang related violence, also, both by educating at-risk\\nyouth to the dangers of gang membership as well a s by depriving known\\ngangs from access to weapons.\\n \\nThe Waco, Texas case involved the execution of search warrants by ATF\\non the Branch Davidians for illegal firearms and explosives possession\\n(automatics, semi-automatics, and machine-guns, in addition to bombs\\nand other explosives.)  In virtually every gun case, ATF is asked to\\ntrace weapons through its\\' National Firearms Tracing Center, where\\nthey keep all dealer and Federal firearms license information.  ATF\\nis the Federal governments\\' firearms expert and routinely works with\\nstate and local police to execute warrants.  ATF, working with state\\nand local law enforcement in Texas and the U.S. Attorneys\\' office\\nfelt it was necessary to execute these warrants in order to legally\\nestablish that a crime had been committed and conclude a long and\\nthorough investigation of illegal gun and explosives held by members\\nof the Branch Davidians.  In addition, ATF carefully selected a\\nSunday morning, knowing from their source, inside, that the men would\\nbe separated from the women and children and not in the area where\\nit was known that the illegal weapons were stored.\\n \\nAs you may be aware by now, Vernon Howell a.k.a. David Koresh\\nspiritual leader of the Branch Davidians was tipped of the impending\\nexecution of the search warrants.  Unfortunately, ATF lost the\\nelement of surprise and the cult was able to arm themselves  and\\nprepare for ATFs\\' entry into the compound.  Once a hostage situation\\npresented itself, the ATF asked the FBI to become involved since the\\nFBI is skilled in hostage negotiations.  In addition, and military\\ntanks were brought in due to the serious nature of the situation and\\nfirepower of the Branch Davidians.\\n \\nBased on what I have learned about ATF\\'s role in the Branch Davidian\\nraid, I believe the agency acted responsibly.  I am, however, deeply\\nsaddened by the loss of lives of the 4 law enforcement agents who\\nattempted to enter the compound and the civilian members of the\\ncult.  I fully expect the Department of  Treasury to conduct a\\nthorough evaluation with representatives from law enforcement outside\\nthe Department to be headed by the Assistant Secretary for\\nEnforcement.  In addition, ATF will conduct its\\' own review of the\\nWaco operation.  I look forward to reviewing the findings of the\\nevaluators and hope this situation in Waco will be brought to a quick\\nand peaceful conclusion.\\n \\nSincerely,\\n \\nDennis DeConcini\\nChairman\\nSubcommittee on Treasury,\\nPostal Service and\\nGeneral Government\\n \\nApril 7, 1993\\n ',\n",

It was as though they had dragged her right side around the whole\\nmicrodistrict, that\\'s how disfigured her face was. I said, \"Fine.\" Mamma was \\nafraid to go into the room, because she went in and hugged Karina and started \\nto cry. I went in. As soon as I saw her my legs gave way. I fell down near the\\nbed, hugged her legs and started kissing them and crying.

I dipped\\na handkerchief into the water and squeezed a little water onto her lips. She \\nsays, \"Lyuda, we\\'re not saved yet, we have to go somewhere else. Out of this \\ndamned house. They want to kill us, I know. They\\'ll find us here, too. We need\\nto call Urshan.\" She repeated this to me for almost a whole hour, Until I \\nunderstood her every word. I ask, \"What\\'s his number?\" Urshan Feyruzovich, \\nthat\\'s the head of the administration where she works. \"We have to call him.\" \\nBut I didn\\'t know his home number. I say, \"Karina, what\\'s his number?\" She \\nsays, \"I can\\'t remember.\" I say, \"Who knows his number? Who can I call?\" She \\nsays, \"I don\\'t know anything, leave me alone.\"\\n\\nI went out of the room. Igor stayed to watch over her and sat there, he was \\ncrying, too. I say, \"Mamma, Karina says that we have to call Urshan. How can \\nwe call him? Who knows his telephone number?\" I tell Marina, \"Think, think, \\nwho can we call to find out?\" She started calling; several people didn\\'t \\nanswer. She called a girlfriend, her girlfriend called another girlfriend and \\nfound out the number and called us back. The boss\\'s wife answered and said he \\nwas at the dacha. My voice keeps cracking, I can\\'t talk normally. She says, \\n\"Lyuda, don\\'t panic, get a hold of yourself, go out to those hooligans and \\ntell them that they just can\\'t do that.\" She still didn\\'t know what was really\\ngoing on. I said, \"It\\'s easy for you to say that, you don\\'t understand what\\'s \\nhappening. They are killing people here.

Of course he didn\\'t know what was happening, either, \\nbecause he brought two of his daughters with him. He came over in his jeep \\nwith his two daughters, like he was going on an outing. He came and saw what \\nshape we were in and what was going on in town and got frightened. He has \\ngrown up daughters, they\\'re almost my age.\\n\\nThe three of us carried out Karina, tossed a coat on her and a warm scarf, and\\nwent down to his car. He took Karina and me to the Maternity Home. . . No, \\nfirst they took us to the po]ice precinct. They had stretchers ready. As\\nsoon as we got out of the car they put Karina and me on stretchers and said\\nthat we were in serious condition and that we mustn\\'t move, we might have\\nfractures. From the stretcher I saw about 30 soldiers sitting and lying on the\\nfirst floor, bandaged, on the concrete floor, groaning . . . This was around\\neleven o\\'clock at night. We had left the house somewhere around 1:30. When I \\nsaw those soldiers I realized that a war was going on: soldiers, enemies\\n. . . everything just like a war.\\n\\nThey carried me into some office on the stretcher. The emergency medical\\npeople from Baku were there. The medical attendant there was an older \\nArmenian. Urshan told him what they had done to Karina because she\\'s so proud \\nshe would never have told. And this aging Armenian . . . his name was Uncle \\nArkady, I think, because someone said \"Arkady, get an injection ready,\" he \\nstarted to fill a syringe, and turned around so as to give Karina a shot. But \\nwhen he looked at her face he became ill. And he was an old man, in his \\nsixties, his hair was all grey, and his moustache, too. He hugged Karina and \\nstarted to cry: \"What have they done to you?!\" He was speaking Armenian. \"What\\nhave they done to you?!\" Karina didn\\'t say anything. Mamma came in then, and \\nshe started to cry, too. The man tried to calm her. \"I\\'ll give you a shot.\" \\nMamma tells him, \"I don\\'t need any shot. Where is the government? Just what \\nare they doing? Look what they\\'ve done to my children! They\\'re killing people,\\nand you\\'re just sitting here!\" Some teacups were standing on the table in \\nthere. \"You\\'re sitting here drinking tea! Look what they\\'ve done to my \\ndaughters! Look what they\\'ve turned them into!\" They gave her something to \\ndrink, some heart medicine, I think. They gave Karina an injection and the\\ndoctor said that she had to be taken to the Maternity Home immediately. Papa \\nand Urshan, I think, even though Papa was in bad shape, helped carry Karina \\nout. When they put her on the stretcher, none of the medics got near her. I \\ndon\\'t know, maybe there weren\\'t any orderlies. Then they came to me: \"What\\'s \\nthe matter with you?\" Their tone was so official that I wrapped myself tighter\\nin the half-length coat. I had a blanket on, too, an orange one, Aunt Tanya\\'s.\\nI said, \"I\\'m fine.\" Uncle Arkady came over and was soothing me, and then told \\nthe doctor, \"You leave, let a woman examine her.\" A woman came, an \\nAzerbaijani, I believe, and said, \"What\\'s wrong with you?\" I was wearing my \\nsister Lyuda\\'s nightshirt, the sister who at this time was in Yerevan. When \\nshe was nursing her infant she had cut out a big hole in it so that it would \\nbe easier to breast feed the baby. I tore the night shirt some more and showed\\nher. I took it off my shoulders and turned my back to her. There was a huge \\nwound, about the size of a hand, on my back, from the Indian vase. She said \\nsomething to them and they gave me two shots. She said that it should be \\ndressed with something, but that they\\'d do that in the hospital.\\n\\nThey put me on a stretcher, too. They started looking for people to carry me. \\nI raised up my head a little and wanted to sit up, and this woman, I don\\'t \\nknow if she was a doctor or a nurse, said, \"Lie still, you mustn\\'t move.\" When\\nI was lying back down I saw two policemen leading a man. His profile seemed \\nvery familiar to me. I shouted, \"Stop!\" One of the policemen turned and says, \\n\"What do you want?\" I say, \"Bring him to me, I want to look at him.\" They \\nbrought him over and I said, \"That person was just in our apartment and he \\njust raped me and my sister. I recognize him, note it down.\" They said, \\n\"Fine,\" but didn\\'t write it down and led him on. I don\\'t know where they were \\ntaking him.\\n\\nThen they put my stretcher near where the injured and beaten soldiers were \\nsitting. They went to look for the ambulance driver so he would bring the car \\nup closer. One of the soldiers started talking to me, \"Sister . . . \" I don\\'t \\nremember the conversation exactly, but he asked me were we lived and what they\\ndid to us. I asked him, \"Where are you from?\" He said that he was from Ufa. \\nApparently they were the first that were brought in. The Ufa police. Later I \\nlearned that they suffered most of all. He says, \"OK, you\\'re Armenians, they \\ndidn\\'t get along with you, but I\\'m a Russian,\" he says, \"what are they trying \\nto kill me for?\" Oh, I remembered something else. When I went out onto the \\nbalcony with Kuliyev for a hammer and nails I looked out the window and saw \\ntwo Azerbaijanis beating a soldier near the kindergarten. He was pressed \\nagainst the fence and he covered his head with his arms, they were beating him\\nwith his own club. The way he cried \"Mamma\" made my skin crawl. I don\\'t know \\nwhat they did to him, if he\\'s still alive or not. And something else. Before \\nhe attack on our house we saw sheets, clothes, and some dishes flying from the\\nthird or fourth floor of the neighboring building, but I didn\\'t think it was \\nAzerbaijanis attacking Armenians. I thought that something was on fire or they\\nwere throwing something they didn\\'t need out, or someone was fighting with \\nsomeone. It was only later, when they were burning a passenger car in the \\nyard, when the neighbors said that they were doing that to the Armenians, that\\nI realized that this was serious, that it was anti-Armenian.\\n\\nThey took Karina and me to the Sumgait Maternity Home. Mamma went to them too \\nand said, \"I\\'ve been beaten too, help me.\" But they just ignored her. My \\nfather went to them and said in a guilty voice, as though it was his fault \\nthat he\\'d been beaten, and says, \"My ribs hurt so much, those creeps have \\nprobably broken my ribs. Please look at them.\" The doctor says, \"That\\'s not my\\njob.\" Urshan said, \"Fine, I\\'ll take you to my place and if we need a doctor, \\nI\\'ll find you one. I\\'ll bring one and have him look at you. And he drove them \\nto his apartment.\\n\\nMarina and I stayed there. They examined us. I was more struck by what the \\ndoctor said than by what those Azerbaijanis in our apartment did to us. I \\nwasn\\'t surprised when they beat us they wanted to beat us, but I was very\\nsurprised that in a Soviet medical facility a woman who had taken the\\nHippocratic Oath could talk to victims like that. By happy--or unhappy--\\ncoincidence we were seen by the doctor that had delivered our Karina. And she,\\nhaving examined Karina, said, \"No problem, you got off pretty good. Not like \\nthey did in Kafan, when you Armenians were killing and raping our women.\\n\"Karina was in such terrible condition that she couldn\\'t say anything--she\\nwould certainly have had something to say! Then they examined me. The same \\nstory. They put us in a separate ward. No shots, no medicinal powders, no \\ndrugs. Absolutely none! They didn\\'t even give us tea. All the women there soon\\nfound out that in ward such and such were Armenians who had been raped. And\\nthey started coming and peering through the keyhole, the way people look at \\nzoo animals. Karina didn\\'t see this, she was lying there, and I kept her from \\nseeing it.\\n\\nThey put Ira B. in our ward. She had also been raped. True, she didn\\'t have \\nany serious bodily injuries, but when she told me what had happened at their \\nplace, I felt worse for them than I did for us. Because when they raped Ira \\nher daughter was in the room, she was under the bed on which it happened. And\\nIra was holding her daughter\\'s hand, the one who was hiding under the bed.\\nWhen they were beating Ira or taking her earrings off, gold, when she \\ninvoluntarily let go of her daughter\\'s hand, her daughter took her hand again.\\nHer daughter is in the fourth grade, she\\'s 11 years old. I felt really awful \\nwhen I heard that. Ira asked them not to harm her daughter, she said, \"Do what\\nyou want with me, just leave my daughter alone.\" Well, they did what they \\nwanted. They threatened to kill her daughter if she got in their way. Now I \\nwould be surprised if the criminals had behaved any other way that night. It \\nwas simply Bartholomew\\'s Night, I say, they did what they would love to do \\nevery day: steal, kill, rape . . .\\n\\nMany are surprised that those animals didn\\'t harm the children. The beasts \\nexplained it like this: this would be repeated in 15 to 20 years, and those \\nchildren would be grown, and then, as they put it, \"we\\'ll come take the \\npleasure out of their lives, those children.\" This was about the girls that\\nwould be young women in 15 years. They were thinking about their tomorrow \\nbecause they were sure that there would be no trial and no investigation, just\\nas there was no trial or investigation in 1915, and that those girls could be \\nof some use in 15 years. This I heard from the investigators; one of the \\nvictims testified to it. That\\'s how they described their own natures, that\\nthey would still be bloodthirsty in 15 to 20 years, and in 100 years--they\\nthemselves said that.\\n\\nAnd this, too. Everyone is surprised that they didn\\'t harm our Marina. Many \\npeople say that they either were drunk or had smoked too much. I don\\'t know \\nwhy their eyes were red. Maybe because they hadn\\'t slept the night before, \\nmaybe for some other reason, I don\\'t know. But they hadn\\'t been smoking and \\nthey weren\\'t drunk, I\\'m positive, because someone who has smoked will stop at \\nnothing he has the urge to do. And they spoke in a cultured fashion with \\nMarina: \"Little sister, don\\'t be afraid, we won\\'t harm you, don\\'t look over \\nthere [where I was], you might be frightened. You\\'re a Muslim, a Muslim woman \\nshouldn\\'t see such things.\" So they were really quite sober . . .\\n\\nSo we came out of that story alive. Each every day we have lived since it all \\nhappened bears the mark of that day. It wasn\\'t even a day, of those several \\nhours. Father still can\\'t look us in the eyes. He still feels guilty for what\\nhappened to Karina, Mother, and me. Because of his nerves he\\'s started talk-\\ning to himself, I\\'ve heard him argue with himself several times when he\\nthought no one is listening: \"Listen,\" he\\'ll say, \"what could I do? What could\\nI do alone, how could I protect them?\" I don\\'t know where to find the words,\\nit\\'s not that I\\'m happy, but I am glad that he didn\\'t see it all happen. \\nThat\\'s the only thing they spared us . . . or maybe it happened by chance. Of \\ncourse he knows it all, but there\\'s no way you could imagine every last detail\\nof what happened. And there were so many conversations: Karina and I spoke\\ntogether in private, and we talked with Mamma, too. But Father was never\\npresent at those conversations. We spare him that, if you can say that. And\\nwhen the investigator comes to the house, we don\\'t speak with Father present.\\n\\nOn February 29, the next clay, Karina and I were discharged from the hospital.\\nFirst they released me, but since martial law had been declared in the city, \\nthe soldiers took me to the police precinct in an armored personnel carrier. \\nThere were many people there, Armenian victims. I met the Tovmasian family \\nthere. From them I learned that Rafik and their Uncle Grant had died. They \\nwere sure that both had died. They were talking to me and Raya, Rafik\\'s wife \\nand Grant\\'s daughter, and her mother, were both crying.\\n\\nThen they took us all out of the office on the first floor into the yard.\\nThere\\'s a little one-room house outside there, a recreation and reading area.\\nThey took us in there. The women were afraid to go because they thought\\nthat they were shooing us out of the police precinct because it had become\\nso dangerous that even the people working at the precinct wanted to hide.\\nThe women were shouting. They explained to them: \"We want to hide you\\nbetter because it\\'s possible there will be an attack on the police precinct.\"\\n\\nWe went into the little house. There were no chairs or tables in there. We\\nhad children with us and they were hungry; we even had infants who needed to \\nhave their diapers changed. No one had anything with them. It was just awful. \\nThey kept us there for 24 hours. From the window of the one room house you \\ncould see that there were Azerbaijanis standing on the fences around the \\npolice precinct, as though they were spying on us. The police precinct is \\nsurrounded by a wall, like a fence, and it\\'s electrified, but if they were \\nstanding on the wall, it means the electricity was shut off. This brought \\ngreat psychological pressure to bear on us, particularly on those who hadn\\'t \\njust walked out of their apartments, but who hadn\\'t slept for 24 hours, or 48,\\nor those who had suffered physically and spiritually, the ones who had lost \\nfamily members. For us it was another ordeal. We were especially frightened \\nwhen all the precinct employees suddenly disappeared. We couldn\\'t see a single\\nperson, not in the courtyard and not in the windows. We thought that they must\\nhave already been hiding under the building, that they must have some secret \\nroom down there. People were panicking: they started throwing themselves at\\none another . . . That\\'s the way it is on a sinking ship. We heard those \\npeople, mainly young people, whistling and whopping on the walls. We felt that\\nthe end was approaching. I was completely terrified: I had left Karina in the \\nhospital and didn\\'t know where my parents were. I was sort of calm about my \\nparents, I was thinking only about Karina, if, Heaven forbid, they should \\nattack the hospital, they would immediately tell them that there was an \\nArmenian in there, and something terrible would happen to Karina again, and \\nshe wouldn\\'t be able to take it.\\n\\nThen soldiers with dogs appeared. When they saw the dogs some of the people \\nclimbed down off the fence. Then they brought in about another 30 soldiers.\\nThey all had machine guns in readiness, their fingers on the triggers. We \\ncalmed down a little. They brought us chairs and brought the children some \\nlittle cots and showed us where we could wash our hands, and took the children\\nto the toilet. But we all sat there hungry, but to be honest, it would never \\nhave occurred to any of us that we hadn\\'t eaten for two days and that people \\ndo eat.\\n\\nThen, closer to nightfall, they brought a group of detained criminals. They \\nwere being watched by soldiers with guard dogs. One of the men came back from \\nthe courtyard and told us about it. Raya Tovmasian . . . it was like a \\ndifferent woman had been substituted. Earlier she had been crying, wailing, \\nand calling out: \"Oh, Rafik!,\" but when she heard about this such a rage came \\nover her! She jumped up, she had a coat on, and she started to roll up her \\nsleeves like she was getting ready to beat someone. And suddenly there were \\nsoldiers, and dogs, and lots of people. She ran over to them. The bandits were\\nstanding there with their hands above their heads facing the wall. She went up\\nto one of them and grabbed him by the collar and started to shake and thrash \\nhim! Then, on to a second, and a third. Everyone was rooted to the spot. Not \\none of the soldiers moved, no one went up to help or made her stop her from \\ndoing it. And the bandits fell down and covered their heads with their hands, \\nmuttering something. She came back and sat down, and something akin to a smile\\nappeared on her face. She became so quiet: no tears, no cries. Then that round\\nwas over and she went back to beat them again. She was walking and cursing \\nterribly: take that, and that, they killed my husband, the bastards, the \\ncreeps, and so on. Then she came back again and sat down. She probably did \\nthis the whole night through, well, it wasn\\'t really night, no one slept. She \\nwent five or six times and beat them and returned. And she told the women, \\n\"What are you sitting there for? They killed your husbands and children, they \\nraped, and you\\'re just sitting there. You\\'re sitting and talking as though \\nnothing had happened. Aren\\'t you Armenians?\" She appealed to everyone, but no \\none got up. I was just numb, I didn\\'t have the strength to beat anyone, I \\ncould barely hold myself up, all the more so since I had been standing for so \\nmany hours--I was released at eleven o\\'clock in the morning and it was already\\nafter ten at night because there weren\\'t enough chairs, really it was the \\nelderly and women with children who sat. I was on my feet the whole time. \\nThere was nothing to breathe, the door was closed, and the men were smoking. \\nThe situation was deplorable.\\n\\nAt eleven o\\'clock at night policemen came for us, local policemen, \\nAzerbaijanis. They said, \"Get up. They\\'ve brought mattresses, you can wash up\\nand put the children to bed.\" Now the women didn\\'t want to leave this place, \\neither. The place had become like home, it was safe, there were soldiers with \\ndogs. If anyone went outside, the soldiers would say, \"Oh, it\\'s our little \\nfamily,\" and things like that. The soldiers felt this love, and probably, for \\nthe first time in their lives perceived themselves as defenders. Everyone\\nspoke from the heart, cried, and hugged them and they, with their loaded\\nmachine guns in their hands, said, \"Grandmother, you mustn\\'t approach me,\\nI\\'m on guard.\" Our people would say, \"Oh, that\\'s all right.\" They hugged\\nthem, one woman even kissed one of the machine guns. This was all terribly\\nmoving for me. And the small children kept wanting to pet the dogs.\\n\\nThey took us up to the second floor and said, \"You can undress and sleep in \\nhere. Don\\'t be afraid, the precinct is on guard, and it\\'s quiet in the city.\"\\nThis was the 29th, when the killing was going on in block 41A and in other\\nplaces. Then we were told that all the Armenians were being gathered at the\\nSK club and at the City Party Committee. They took us there. On the way I \\nasked them to stop at the Maternity Home: I wanted to take Karina with me.\\nI didn\\'t know what was happening there. They told me, \"Don\\'t worry, the\\nMaternity Home is full of soldiers, more than mothers-to-be. So you can rest\\nassured. I say, \"Well, I won\\'t rest assured regardless, because the staff in\\nthere is capable of anything.\"\\n\\nWhen I arrived at the City Party Committee it turned out that Karina had\\nalready been brought there. They had seen fit to release her from the hospi-\\ntal, deciding that she felt fine and was no longer in need of any care. Once\\nwe were in the City Party Committee we gave free reign to our tears. We met \\nacquaintances, but everyone was somehow divided into two groups, those who \\nhadn\\'t been injured, who were clothed, who had brought a pot of food with \\nthem, and so on, and those, like me, like Raya, who were wearing whatever had \\ncome their way. There were even people who were all made up, dolled up like \\nthey had come from a wedding. There were people without shoes, naked people, \\nhungry people, those who were crying, and those who had lost someone. And of \\ncourse the stories and the talk were flying: \"Oh, I heard that they killed \\nhim!\" \"What do you mean they killed him!\" \"He stayed at work!\" \"Do you know \\nwhat\\'s happening at this and such a plant? Talk like that.\\n\\nAnd then I met Aleksandr Mikhailovich Gukasian, the teacher. I know him very \\nwell and respect him highly. I\\'ve known him for a long time. They had a small \\nroom, well really it was more like a study-room. We spent a whole night \\ntalking in that study once. On March 1 we heard that Bagirov [First Secretary \\nof the Communist Party of Azerbaijan SSR] had arrived. Everyone ran to see \\nBagirov, what news he had brought with him and how this was all being viewed \\nfrom outside. He arrived and everyone went up to him to talk to him and ask \\nhim things. Everyone was in a tremendous rage. But he was protected by \\nsoldiers, and he went up to the second floor and didn\\'t deign to speak with \\nthe people. Apparently he had more important things to do.\\n\\nSeveral hours passed. Gukasian called me and says, \"Lyudochka, find another \\ntwo or three. We\\'re going to make up lists, they asked for them upstairs, \\nlists of the dead, those whose whereabouts are unknown, and lists of people \\nwho had pogroms of their apartments and of those whose cars were burned.\" I \\nhad about 50 people in my list when they called me and said, \"Lyuda, your \\nMamma has arrived, she\\'s looking for you, she doesn\\'t believe that you are \\nalive and well and that you\\'re here.\" I gave the lists to someone and asked \\nthem to continue what I was doing and went off.\\n\\nThe list was imprecise, of course. It included Grant Adamian, Raya Tovmasian\\'s\\nfather, who was alive, but at the time they thought him dead. There was Engels\\nGrigorian\\'s father and aunt, Cherkez and Maria. The list also included the \\nname of my girlfriend and neighbor, Zhanna Agabekian. One of the guys said \\nthat he had been told that they chopped her head off in the courtyard in front\\nof the Kosmos movie theater. We put her on the list too, and cried, but later \\nit turned out that that was just a rumor, that in fact an hour earlier she had\\nsomehow left Sumgait for the marina and from there had set sail for \\nKrasnovodsk, where, thank God, she was alive and well. I should also say that \\nin addition to those who died that list contained people who were rumored \\nmissing or who were so badly wounded that they were given up for dead.                                                                 3\\n\\nAll the lists were taken to Bagirov. I don\\'t remember how many dead were \\ncontained in the list, but it\\'s a fact that when Gukasian came in a couple \\nof minutes later he was cursing and was terribly irate. I asked, \"What\\'s \\ngoing on?\" He said, \"Lyuda, can you imagine what animals, what scoundrels\\nthey are! They say that they lost the list of the dead. Piotr Demichev\\n[Member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party\\nof the USSR] has just arrived, and we were supposed to submit the list to\\nhim, so that he\\'d see the scope of the slaughter, of the tragedy, whether it\\nwas one or fifty.\" They told him that the list had disappeared and they\\nshould ask everyone who hadn\\'t left for the Khimik boarding house all over\\nagain. There were 26 people on our second list. I think that the number 26\\nwas the one that got into the press and onto television and the radio, because\\nthat\\'s the list that Demichev got. I remember exactly that there were 26 \\npeople on the list, I had even told Aleksandr Mikhailovich that that was only \\na half of those that were on the first list. He said, \"Lyuda, please, try to\\nremember at least one more.\" But I couldn\\'t remember anyone else. But there\\nwere more than 30 dead. Of that I am certain. The government and the Procuracy\\ndon\\'t count the people who died of fright, like sick people and old people \\nwhose lives are threatened by any shock. They weren\\'t registered as victims of\\nthe Sumgait tragedy. And then there may be people we didn\\'t know. So many \\npeople left Sumgait between March 1 and 8! Most of them left for smaller towns\\nin Russia, and especially to the Northern Caucasus, to Stavropol, and the \\nKrasnodarsk Territory. We don\\'t have any information on them. I know that \\nthere are people who set out for parts around Moscow. In the periodical \\nKrestyanka [Woman Farmer] there was a call for people who know how to milk \\ncows, and for mechanics, and drivers, and I know a whole group of people went \\nto help out. Also clearly not on our list are those people who died entering\\nthe city, who were burned in their cars. No one knows about them, except the \\nAzerbaijanis, who are hardly likely to say anything about it. And there\\'s\\nmore. A great many of the people who were raped were not included in the list \\ndrawn up at the Procuracy. I know of three instances for sure, and I of course\\ndon\\'t know them all. I\\'m thinking of three women whose parents chose not to \\npublicize what had happened, that is, they didn\\'t take the matter to court, \\nthey simply left. But in so doing they didn\\'t cease being victims. One of them\\nis the first cousin of my classmate Kocharian. She lived in Microdistrict No. \\n8, on the fifth floor. I can\\'t tell you the building number and I don\\'t know \\nher name. Then comes the neighbor of one of my relatives, she lived in \\nMicrodistrict 1 near the gift shop. I don\\'t know her name, she lives on the \\nsame landing as the Sumgait procurator. They beat her father, he was holding \\nthe door while his daughter hid, but he couldn\\'t hold the door forever, and \\nwhen she climbed over the balcony to the neighbors\\' they seized her by her \\nbraid. Like the Azerbaijanis were saying, it was a very cultured mob, because \\nthey didn\\'t kill anyone, they only raped them and left. And the third one \\n. . . I don\\'t remember who the third one was anymore.\\n\\nThey transferred us on March 1. Karina still wasn\\'t herself. Yes, we lived for\\ndays in the SK, in the cultural facility, and at the Khimik. They lived there \\nand I lived at the City Party Committee because I couldn\\'t stay with Karina; \\nit was too difficult for me, but I was at peace: she had survived. I could \\nalready walk, but really it was honest words that held me up. Thanks to the \\nsocial work I did there, I managed to persevere. Aleksandr Mikhailovich said, \\n\"If it weren\\'t for the work I would go insane.\" He and I put ourselves in gear\\nand took everything upon ourselves: someone had an infant and needed diapers \\nand free food, and we went to get them. The first days we bought everything, \\nalthough we should have received it for free. They were supposed to have been \\ndispensed free of charge, and they sold it to us. Then, when we found out it \\nwas free, we went to Krayev. At the time, fortunately, you could still drop by\\nto see him like a neighbor, all the more so since everything was still clearly\\nvisible on our faces. Krayev sent a captain down and he resolved the issue.\\n\\nOn March 2 they sent two investigators to see us: Andrei Shirokov and Vladimir\\nFedorovich Bibishev. The way it worked out, in our family they had considered \\nonly Karina and me victims, maybe because she and I wound up in the hospital.\\nMother and Father are considered witnesses, but not victims.\\n\\nShirokov was involved with Karina\\'s case, and Bibishev, with mine. After I \\ntold him everything, he and I planned to sit down with the identikit and\\nrecord everyone I could remember while everything was still fresh in my mind. \\nWe didn\\'t work with the identikit until the very last day because the\\nconditions weren\\'t there. The investigative group worked slowly and did poor \\nquality work solely because the situation wasn\\'t conducive to working: there \\nweren\\'t enough automobiles, especially during the time when there was a \\ncurfew, and there were no typewriters for typing transcripts, and no still or \\nvideo cameras. I think that this was done on purpose. We\\'re not so poor that \\nwe can\\'t supply our investigators with all that stuff. It was done especially \\nto draw out the investigation, all the more so since the local authorities saw\\nthat the Armenians were leaving at the speed of light, never to return to \\nSumgait. And the Armenians had a lot to say I came to an agreement with \\nBibishev, I told him myself, \"Don\\'t you worry, if it takes us a month or two \\nmonths, I\\'ll be here. I\\'m not afraid, I looked death in the eyes five times in\\nthose two days, I\\'ll help you conduct the investigation.\"\\n\\nHe and I worked together a great deal, and I used this to shelter Karina, I\\ngave them so much to do that for a while they didn\\'t have the time to get to\\nher, so that she would at least have a week or two to get back to being her-\\nself. She was having difficulty breathing so we looked for a doctor to take x-\\nrays. She couldn\\'t eat or drink for nine days, she was nauseous. I didn\\'t eat\\nand drank virtually nothing for five days. Then, on the fifth day, when we\\nwere in Baku already, the investigator told me, \"How long can you go on like \\nthis? Well fine, so you don\\'t want to eat, you don\\'t love yourself, you\\'re\\nnot taking care of yourself, but you gave your word that you would see this\\ninvestigation through. We need you.\" Then I started eating, because in fact I\\nwas exhausted. It wasn\\'t enough that I kept seeing those faces in our apart-\\nment in my mind, every day I went to the investigative solitary confinement\\ncells and prisons. I don\\'t know . . . we were just everywhere! Probably in\\nevery prison in the city of Baku and in all the solitary confinement cells of\\nSumgait. At that time they had even turned the drunk tank into solitary \\nconfinement.\\n\\nThus far I have identified 31 of the people who were in our apartment. Mamma \\nidentified three, and Karina, two. The total is 36. Marina didn\\'t identify \\nanyone, she remembers the faces of two or three, But they weren\\'t among the \\nphotographs of those detained. I told of the neighbor I recognized. The one \\nwho went after the axe. He still hasn\\'t been detained, he\\'s still on the \\nloose. He\\'s gone, and it\\'s not clear if he will be found or not. I don\\'t know \\nhis first or last name. I know which building he lived in and I know his \\nsisters\\' faces. But he\\'s not in the city. The investigators informed me that \\neven if the investigation is closed and even if the trial is over they will \\ncontinue looking for him.\\n\\nThe 31 people I identified are largely blue-collar workers from various \\nplants, without education, and of the very lowest level in every respect.\\nMostly their ages range from 20 to 30 years; there was one who was 48. Only\\none of them was a student. He was attending the Azerbaijan Petroleum and\\nChemical Institute in Sumgait, his mother kept trying to bribe the investiga-\\ntor. Once, thinking that I was an employee and not a victim, she said in front\\nof me \"I\\'ll set you up a restaurant worth 500 rubles and give you 600 in cash\\nsimply for keeping him out of Armenia,\" that is, to keep him from landing in\\na prison on Armenian soil. They\\'re all terribly afraid of that, because if the\\ninvestigator is talking with a criminal and the criminal doesn\\'t confess even\\nthough we identified him, they tell him--in order to apply psychological\\npressure--they say, \"Fine, don\\'t confess, just keep silent. When you\\'re in an\\nArmenian prison, when they find out who you are, they\\'ll take care of you\\nin short order.\" That somehow gets to them. Many give in and start to talk.\\n\\nThe investigators and I were in our apartment and videotaped the entire\\npogrom of our apartment, as an investigative experiment. It was only then\\nthat I saw the way they had left our apartment. Even without knowing who was \\nin our apartment, you could guess. They stole, for example, all the money and \\nall the valuables, but didn\\'t take a single book. They tore them up, burned \\nthem, poured water on them, and hacked them with axes. Only the Materials\\nfrom the 27th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and James \\nFenimore Cooper\\'s Last of the Mohigans. Oh yes, lunch was ready, we were \\nboiling a chicken, and there were lemons for tea on the table. After they had \\nbeen in our apartment, both the chicken and the lemons were gone. That\\'s \\nenough to tell you what kind of people were in our apartment, people who don\\'t\\neven know anything about books. They didn\\'t take a single book, but they did \\ntake worn clothing, food, and even the cheapest of the cheap, worn-out \\nslippers.\\n\\nOf those whom I identified, four were Kafan Azerbaijanis living in Sumgait. \\nBasically, the group that went seeking \"revenge\"--let\\'s use their word for \\nit--was joined by people seeking easy gain and thrill-seekers. I talked with \\none of them. He had gray eyes, and somehow against the back-drop of all that \\nblack I remembered him specifically because of his of his eyes. Besides taking\\npart in the pogrom of our apartment, he was also involved in the murder of \\nTamara Mekhtiyeva from Building 16. She was an older Armenian who had recently\\narrived from Georgia, she lived alone and did not have anyone in Sumgait. I \\ndon\\'t know why she had a last name like that, maybe she was married to an \\nAzerbaijani. I had laid eyes on this woman only once or twice, and know \\nnothing about her. I do know that they murdered her in her apartment with an \\naxe. Murdering her wasn\\'t enough for them. They hacked her into pieces and \\nthrew them into the tub with water.\\n\\nI remember another guy really well too, he was also rather fair-skinned. You \\nknow, all the people who were in our apartment were darker than dark, both \\ntheir hair and their skin. And in contrast with them, in addition to the grey-\\neyed one, I remember this one fellow, the one l took to be a Lezgin. I \\nidentified him. As it turned out he was Eduard Robertovich Grigorian, born\\nin the city of Sumgait, and he had been convicted twice. One of our own. How \\ndid I remember him? The name Rita was tattooed on his left or right hand. I \\nkept thinking, is that Rita or \"puma,\" which it would be if you read the word \\nas Latin characters instead of Cyrillic, because the Cyrillic \"T\" was the one \\nthat looks like a Latin \"M.\" When they led him in he sat with his hands behind\\nhis back. This was at the confrontation. He swore on every holy book, tried to\\nput in an Armenian word here and there to try and spark my compassion, and \\ntold me that I was making a mistake, and called me \"dear sister.\" He said, \\n\"You\\'re wrong, how could I, an Armenian, raise my hand against my own, an \\nArmenian,\" and so on. He spoke so convincingly that even the investigator \\nasked me, \"Lyuda, are you sure it was he?\" I told him, \"I\\'ll tell you one more\\nidentifying mark. If I\\'m wrong I shall apologize and say I was mistaken. The \\nname Rita is tattooed on his left or right hand.\" He went rigid and became \\npale. They told him, \"Put your hands on the table.\" He put his hands on the\\ntable with the palms up. I said, \"Now turn your hands over,\" but he didn\\'t \\nturn his hands over. Now this infuriated me. If he had from the very start\\nacknowledged his guilt and said that he hadn\\'t wanted to do it, that they \\nforced him or something else, I would have treated him somewhat differently.\\nBut he insolently stuck to his story, \"No, I did not do anything, it wasn\\'t \\nme.\" When they turned his hands over the name Rita was in fact tattooed on his\\nhand. His face distorted and he whispered something wicked. I immediately flew\\ninto a rage. There was an ashtray on the table, a really heavy one, made out \\nof granite or something, very large, and it had ashes and butts in it. \\nCatching myself quite by surprise, I hurled that ashtray at him. But he ducked\\nand the ashtray hit the wall, and ashes and butts rained down on his head and \\nback. And he smiled. When he smiled it provoked me further. I don\\'t know how, \\nbut I jumped over the table between us and started either pounding him or \\nstrangling him; I no longer remember which. When I jumped I caught the \\nmicrophone cord. The investigator was there, Tolya . . .I no longer recall his\\nlast name, and he says, \"Lyudochka, it\\'s a Japanese microphone! Please . . .\\n\" And shut off all the equipment on the spot, it was all being video taped. \\nThey took him away. I stayed, and they talked to me a little to calm me down, \\nbecause we needed to go on working, I only remember Tolya telling me, \"You\\'re \\nsome actress! What a performance!\" I said, \"Tolya, honestly . . . \" Beforehand\\nthey would always tell me, \"Lyuda, more emotion. You speak as calmly as if \\nnothing had happened to you.\" I say, \"I don\\'t have any more strength or \\nemotion. All my emotions are behind me now, I no longer have the strength \\n. . . I don\\'t have the strength to do anything.\" And he says, \"Lyuda, how were\\nyou able to do that?\" And when I returned to normal, drinking tea and watching\\nthe tape, I said, \"Can I really have jumped over that table? I never jumped \\nthat high in gym class.\"\\n\\nSo you could say the gang that took over our apartment was international. Of \\nthe 36 we identified there was an Armenian, a Russian, Vadim Vorobyev, who \\nbeat Mamma, and 34 Azerbaijanis.\\n\\nAt the second meeting with Grigorian, when he had completely confessed his \\nguilt, he told of how on February 27 the Azerbaijanis had come knocking. Among\\nthem were guys--if you can call them guys--he knew from prison. They said, \\n\"Tomorrow we\\'re going after the Armenians. Meet us at the bus station at three\\no\\'clock.\" He said, \"No, I\\'m not coming.\" They told him, \"If you don\\'t come \\nwe\\'ll kill you.\" He said, \"Alright, I\\'ll come.\" And he went.\\n\\nThey also went to visit my classmate from our microdistrict, Kamo Pogosian. He\\nhad also been in prison; I think that together they had either stolen a \\nmotorcycle or dismantled one to get some parts they needed. They called him \\nout of his apartment and told him the same thing: \"Tomorrow we\\'re going to get\\nthe Armenians. Be there.\" He said, \"No.\" They pulled a knife on him. He said, \\n\"I\\'m not going all the same.\" And in the courtyard on the 27th they stabbed \\nhim several times, in the stomach. He was taken to the hospital. I know he was\\nin the hospital in Baku, in the Republic hospital. If we had known about that \\nwe would have had some idea of what was to come on the 28th.\\n\\nI\\'ll return to Grigorian, what he did in our apartment. I remember that he\\nbeat me along with all the rest. He spoke Azerbaijani extremely well. But he\\nwas very fair-skinned, maybe that led me to think that they had it out for\\nhim, too. But later it was proved that he took part in the beating and burning\\nof Shagen Sargisian. I don\\'t know if he participated in the rapes in our \\napartment; I didn\\'t see, I don\\'t remember. But the people who were in our \\napartment who didn\\'t yet know that he was an Armenian said that he did. I \\ndon\\'t know if he confessed or not, and I myself don\\'t recall because I blacked\\nout very often. But I think that he didn\\'t participate in the rape of Karina\\nbecause he was in the apartment the whole time. When they carried her into the\\ncourtyard, he remained in the apartment.\\n\\nAt one point I was talking with an acquaintance about Edik Grigorian. From her\\nI learned that his wife was a dressmaker, his mother is Russian, he doesn\\'t \\nhave a father, and that he\\'s been convicted twice. Well this will be his third\\nand, I hope, last sentence. He beat his wife, she was eternally coming to work\\nwith bruises. His wife was an Armenian by the name of Rita.\\n\\nThe others who were detained . . . well they\\'re little beasts. You really can\\'t\\ncall them beasts, they\\'re just little beasts. They were robots carrying out\\nsomeone else\\'s will, because at the investigation they all said, \"I don\\'t \\nunderstand how I could have done that, I was out of my head.\" But we know that\\nthey were won around to it and prepared for it, that\\'s why they did it. In the\\nname of Allah, in the name of the Koran, in the name of propagating Islam--\\nthat\\'s holy to them--that\\'s why they did everything they were commanded to do.\\nBecause I saw they didn\\'t have minds of their own, I\\'m not talking about their\\nlevel of cultural sophistication or any higher values. No education, they\\nwork, have a slew of children without the means to raise them properly, they \\ncrowd them in, like at the temporary housing, and apparently, they were \\npromised that if they slaughtered the Armenians they would receive apartments.\\nSo off they went. Many of them explained their participation saying, \"they \\npromised us apartments.\"\\n\\nAmong them was one who genuinely repented. I am sure that he repented from the\\nheart and that he just despised himself after the incident. He worked at a \\nchildren\\'s home, an Azerbaijani, he has two children, and his wife works at \\nthe children\\'s home too. Everything that they acquired, everything that they \\nhave they earned by their own labor, and wasn\\'t inherited from parents or \\ngrandparents. And he said, \"I didn\\'t need anything I just don\\'t know . . . how\\nI ended up in that; it was like some hand was guiding me. I had no will of my \\nown, I had no strength, no masculine dignity, nothing.\" And the whole time I\\nkept repeating, \"Now you imagine that someone did the same to your young wife \\nright before your own eyes.\" He sat there and just wailed.\\n\\nBut that leader in the Eskimo dogskin coat was not detained. He performed a \\nmarvelous disappearing act, but I think that they\\'ll get onto him, they just \\nhave to work a little, because that Vadim, that boy, according to his\\ngrandfather, is in touch with the young person who taught him what to do, how \\nto cover his tracks. He was constantly exchanging jackets with other boys he \\nknew and those he didn\\'t, either, and other things as well, and changed \\nhimself like a chameleon so they wouldn\\'t get onto him, but he was detained.\\n\\nThat one in the Eskimo dogskin coat was at the Gambarians\\' after Aleksandr \\nGambarian was murdered. He came in and said, \"Let\\'s go, enough, you\\'ve spilled\\nenough blood here.\"\\n\\nMaybe Karina doesn\\'t know this but the reason they didn\\'t finish her off was \\nthat they were hoping to take her home with them. I heard this from Aunt Tanya\\nand her sons, the Kasumovs, who were in the courtyard near the entryway. They \\nliked her very much, and they had decided to take her to home with them. When \\nKarina came to at one point--she doesn\\'t remember this yet, this the neighbors \\nold me--and she saw that there was no one around her, she started crawling to \\nthe entryway. They saw that she was still alive and came back, they were \\nalready at the third entryway, on their way to the Gambarians\\'. They came back\\nand started beating her to finish her. If she had not come to she would have \\nsustained lesser bodily injuries, they would have beat her less. An older \\nwoman from our building, Aunt Nazan, an Azerbaijani, all but lay on top of \\nKarina, crying and pleading that they leave her alone, but they flung her off.\\nThe woman\\'s grown sons were right nearby; they picked her up in their hands \\nand led her home. She howled and cried out loudly and swore: God is on Earth, \\nhe sees everything, and He won\\'t forgive this.\\n\\nThere was another woman, too, Aunt Fatima, a sick, aging woman from the first \\nfloor, she\\'s already retired. Mountain dwellers, and Azerbaijanis, too, have a\\ncustom: If men are fighting, they throw a scarf under their feet to stop them.\\nBut they trampled her scarf and sent her home. To trample a scarf is \\ntantamount to trampling a woman\\'s honor.\\n\\nNow that the investigation is going on, now that a lot is behind us and we \\nhave gotten back to being ourselves a little, I think about how could these \\nevents that are now called the Sumgait tragedy happen? How did they come \\nabout? How did it start? Could it have been avoided? Well, it\\'s clear that \\nwithout a signal, without permission from the top leadership, it would not \\nhave happened. All the same, I\\'m not afraid to say this, the Azerbaijanis,\\nlet other worthy people take no offense, the better representatives of their \\nnations, let them take no offense, but the Azerbaijanis in their majority are \\na people who are kept in line only by fear of the law, fear of retribution for\\nwhat they have done. And when the law said that they could do all that, like\\nunleashed dogs who were afraid they wouldn\\'t have time to do everything, they \\nthrew themselves from one thing to the next so as to be able to get more done,\\nto snatch a bit more. The smell of the danger was already in the air on\\nFebruary 27. You could tell that something was going to happen. And everyone \\nwho had figured it out took steps to avoid running into those gangs. Many left\\nfor their dachas, got plane tickets for the other end of the country, just got\\nas far away as their legs would carry them.\\n\\nFebruary 27 was a Saturday. I was teaching my third class. The director came \\ninto my classroom and said that I should let the children out, that there had \\nbeen a call from the City Party Committee asking that all teachers gather for \\na meeting at Lenin Square. Well, I excused the children, and there were few \\nteachers left at school, altogether three women, the director, and six or \\nseven men. The rest had already gone home. We got to Lenin Square and there \\nwere a great many people there. This was around five-thirty or six in the \\nevening, no later. They were saying all kinds of rubbish up on the podium and \\nthe crowd below was supporting them stormily, roaring. They spoke over the \\nmicrophone about what had happened in Kafan a few days earlier and that the \\ndriver of a bus going to some district had recently thrown a small Azerbaijani\\nchild off the bus. The speaker affirmed that he was an eyewitness, that he had\\nseen it himself..The crowd started to rage: \"Death to the Armenians! They must\\nbe killed!\" Then a woman went up on stage. I didn\\'t see the woman because \\npeople were clinging to the podium like flies. I could only hear her. The \\nwoman introduced herself as coming from Kafan, and said that the Armenians \\ncut her daughters\\' breasts off, and called, \"Sons, avenge my daughters!\" That \\nwas enough. A portion of the people on the square took off running in the \\ndirection of the factories, toward the beginning of Lenin Street.\\n\\nWe stood there about an hour. Then the director of School 25 spoke, he gave a \\nvery nationalist speech. He said, \"Brother Muslims, kill the Armenians!\" This \\nhe repeated every other sentence. When he said this the crowd supported him \\nstormily, whistling and shouting \"Karabagh!\" He said, \"Karabagh has been our \\nterritory my whole life long, Karabagh is my soul. How can you tear out my \\nheart?\" As though an Azerbaijani would die without Karabagh. \"It\\'s our \\nterritory, the Armenians will never see it. The Armenians must be eliminated. \\nFrom time immemorial Muslims have cleansed the land of infidel Armenians, from\\ntime immemorial, that\\'s the way nature created it, that every 20 to 30 years \\nthe Azerbaijanis should cleanse the land of filth.\" By filth he meant \\nArmenians.\\n\\nI heard this. Before that I hadn\\'t been listening to the speeches closely.\\nMany people spoke and I stood with my back to the podium, talking shop with \\nthe other teachers, and somehow it all went right by, it didn\\'t penetrate,\\nthat in fact something serious was taking place. Then, when one of our\\nteachers said, \"Listen to what he\\'s saying, listen to what idiocy he\\'s \\nspouting,\" we listened. That was the speech of that director. Before that we \\nlistened to the woman\\'s speech.\\n\\nRight then in our group--there were nine of us--the mood changed, and the \\nsubject of conversation and all school matters were forgotten. Our director of\\nstudies, for whom I had great respect, he\\'s an Azerbaijani . . . Before that I\\nhad considered him an upstanding and worthy person, if there was a need to \\nobtain leave we had asked him, he seemed like a good person. So he tells me,\\n\"Lyuda, you know that besides you there are no Armenians on the square? If \\nthey find out that you\\'re an Armenian they\\'ll tear you to pieces. Should I \\ntell them you\\'re an Armenian? Should I tell them you\\'re an Armenian?\" When he \\nsaid it the first time I pretended not to hear it, and then he asked me a \\nsecond time. I turned to the director, Khudurova, and said that it was already\\nafter eight, I was expected at home, and I should be leaving. She answered, \\n\"No, they said that women should stay here until ten o\\'clock,.and men, until \\ntwelve. Stay here.\" There was a young teacher with us, her children were in \\nkindergarten and her husband worked shifts. She asked to leave: \"I left my \\nchildren at the kindergarten.\" The director excused her. When she let her go I\\nturned around, said, \"Good-bye,\" and left with the young teacher, the \\nAzerbaijani. I didn\\'t see them after that.\\n\\nWhen we were walking the buses weren\\'t running, and a crowd from the rally ran\\nnearby us. They had apparently gotten all fired up. It must have become too \\nmuch for them, and they wanted to seek vengeance immediately, so they rushed \\noff. I wasn\\'t afraid this time because I was sure that the other teacher \\nwouldn\\'t say that I was an Armenian.\\n\\nTo make it short, we reached home. Then Karina told of how they had been at \\nthe movies and what had happened there. I started telling of my experience and\\nagain my parents didn\\'t understand that we were in danger. We watched \\ntelevision as usual, and didn\\'t even imagine that tomorrow would be our last \\nday. That\\'s how it all was.\\n\\nAt the City Party Committee I met an acquaintance, we went to school together,\\nZhanna, I don\\'t remember her last name, she lives above the housewares store \\non Narimanov Street. She was there with her father, for some reason she \\ndoesn\\'t have a mother. The two of them were at home alone. While her father \\nheld the door she jumped from the third floor, and she was lucky that the \\nground was wet and that there wasn\\'t anyone behind the building when she went \\nout on the balcony, there was no one there, they were all standing near the \\nentryway. That building was also a lucky one in that there were no murders \\nthere. She jumped. She jumped and didn\\'t feel any pain in the heat of the \\nmoment. A few days later I found out that she couldn\\'t stand up, she had been \\ninjured somehow. That\\'s how people in Sumgait saved their lives, their honor, \\nand their children: any way they could. \\n\\nWhere it was possible, the Armenians fought back. My father\\'s first cousin, \\nArmen M., lives in Block 30. They found out by phone from one of the victims \\nwhat was going on in town. The Armenians in that building all called one \\nanother immediately and all of them armed themselves with axes, knives, even \\nwith muskets and went up to the roof. They took their infants with them, and \\ntheir old women who had been in bed for God knows how many months, they got \\nthem right out of their beds and took everyone upstairs. They hooked \\nelectricity up to the trap door to the roof and waited, ready to fight. Then \\nthey took the daughter of the school board director hostage, she\\'s an \\nAzerbaijani who lived in their building. They called the school board director\\nand told her that if she didn\\'t help them, the 17 Armenians on the roof, to \\nescape alive and unharmed, she\\'d never see her daughter again. I\\'m sure, of \\ncourse, that Armenians would never lay a hand on a woman, it was just the only\\nthing that could have saved them at the time. She called the police. The \\nArmenians made a deal with the local police to go into town. Two armored \\npersonnel carriers and soldiers were summoned They surrounded the entryway and\\nled everyone down from the roof, and off to the side from the armored \\npersonnel carriers was a crowd that was on its way to the building at that \\nvery moment, into Block 30. That\\'s how they defended themselves.\\n\\nI heard that our neighbors, Roman and Sasha Gambarian, resisted. They\\'re big, \\nstrong guys. Their father was killed. And I heard that the brothers put up a \\nstrong defense and lost their father, but were able to save their mother.\\n\\nOne of the neighbors told me that after it happened, when they were looking \\nfor the criminals on March 1 to 2 and detaining everyone they suspected, \\npeople hid people in our entryway, maybe people who were injured or perhaps \\ndead. The neighbors themselves were afraid to go there, and when they went \\nwith the soldiers into our basement they are supposed to have found \\nAzerbaijani corpses. I don\\'t know how many. Even if they had been wounded and \\nput down there, after two days they would have died from loss of blood or \\ninfection--that basement was filled with water. I heard this from the \\nneighbors. And later when I was talking with the investigators the subject \\ncame up and they confirmed it. I know, too, that for several hours the \\nbasement was used to store objects stolen from our apartment. And our neighbor\\ncarried out our carpet, along with the rest: he stole it for himself, posing \\nas one of the criminals. Everyone was taking his own share, and the neighbor \\ntook his, too, and carried it home. And when we came back, when everything \\nseemed to have calmed down, he returned it, saying that it was the only thing \\nof ours he had managed to \"save.\"\\n\\nRaya\\'s husband and father defended themselves. The Trdatovs defended \\nthemselves, and so did other Armenian families. To be sure there were\\nAzerbaijani victims, although we\\'ll never hear anything about them. For some \\nreason our government doesn\\'t want to say that the Armenians were not just \\nvictims, but that they defended the honor of their sisters and mothers, too. \\nIn the TV show \"Pozitsiya\" [Viewpoint] a military man, an officer, said that \\nthe Armenians did virtually nothing to defend themselves. But that\\'s not \\nimportant, the truth will come out regardless.\\n\\nSo that\\'s the price we paid those three days. For three days our courage, our \\nbravery, and our humanity was tested. It was those three days, and not the \\nyears and dozens of years we had lived before them, that showed what we\\'ve \\nbecome, what we grew up to be. Those three days showed who was who.\\n\\nOn that I will conclude my narrative on the Sumgait tragedy. It should be said\\nthat it\\'s not over yet, the trials are still ahead of us, and the punishments\\nreceived by those who so violated us, who wanted to make us into nonhumans \\nwill depend on our position and on the work of the investigators, the \\nProcuracy, and literally of every person who lent his hand to the investiga-\\ntion. That\\'s the price we paid to live in Armenia, to not fear going out on \\nthe street at night, to not be afraid to say we\\'re Armenians, and to not fear\\nspeaking our native tongue.\\n\\n   October 15,1988\\n   Yerevan\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t- - - reference for #008 - - -\\n\\n[1] _The Sumgait Tragedy; Pogroms against Armenians in Soviet Azerbaijan,\\n    Volume I, Eyewitness Accounts_, edited by Samuel Shahmuradian, forward by\\n    Yelena Bonner, 1990, published by Aristide D.

       " 'The article that follows was taken from the Wednesday, April 14, 1993\\nissue of USA Today (\"Drug Use Up Among U.S. eighth-graders\" by Mike\\nSnider, p. 6D).\\n\\n    A new national survey says drugs are easier to get, more teens are\\n    using them and fewer deem drug use as risky. \\n\\n    For the last two years, government officials have trumpeted results\\n    from the National High School Survey as signs that the drug war is\\n    being won.  But this year, officials are retreating - drug use by\\n    eighth-graders has risen, according to the survey of 50,000 students\\n    nationwide.\\n\\n    Possible reason for the increase:  more experimentation.  Why?  If\\n    drug use dropped during the \\'80s, eventually some students will\\n    have fewer \"drug-using contemporaries\" who act as examples of\\n    substance abuse\\'s drawbacks, says social psychologist Lloyd Johnston,\\n    one of the survey authors.  Each new wave of youths \"must be given\\n    the knowledge, skills and motivation to resist using these drugs,\"\\n    Johnston says.\\n\\n    This type of resurgence \"is possible,\" says Eileen Shiff, author of\\n    \"Experts Advise Parents\" (Delta, $14.95).  But that\\'s not the issue,\\n    she says.  The prevalence of alcohol and drugs among teens today\\n    could result in more alcoholic adults decades from now.\\n\\n    Aggravating the problem:  baby boomer parents - who experimented with\\n    drugs and alcohol as teens - trying to be friends, not parents, to\\n    their children.  \"I\\'ve even seen parents serving kegs of beer\" to\\n    their underage kids and friends, Shiff says.  For a recent graduation,\\n    Shiff and other parents organized an all-night, \"lock-in\" party where\\n    no booze or drugs were allowed.  \"We need to fulfill that parental\\n    role, otherwise the peer group takes over,\" she says.\\n\\n    Officials may \"talk about the war on drugs, but they really haven\\'t\\n    done anything that I\\'ve seen,\" says Suzanne Linkous, Scottsdale,\\n    Ariz., 16, a volunteer who talks with teens about drugs, dating and\\n    other issues on a peer counseling and suicide hot line.  Linkous, a\\n    member of USA Today\\'s Teen Panel, says \"there\\'s always going to be\\n    experimentation\" with drugs.\\n\\n    A real war on drugs could be waged \"education-wise,\" she says.  But\\n    \"some don\\'t want to give kids the facts.  They think it will give\\n    them ideas; it\\'s the same with birth control.  I think you should\\n    give the kids the information or have it accessible\" through classes,\\n    pamphlets and speakers, she says.\\n\\n    Education efforts need to start as soon as kids get in school - in\\n    kindergarten, says Dallas Owens, 17, teen panelist from Miami Shores,\\n    Fla.  \"I remember in kindergarten, I used to see (drugs).  I think\\n    kids in the 10th and 12th grades have already made up their minds\\n    (about using drugs),\" he says.\\n\\n    Scare tactics in public service announcements aren\\'t working; only\\n    one commercial has gotten it right, he says.  The commercial opens\\n    with two \"good-looking girls\" in the restroom talking about having\\n    no prom date.  Then they take a hit off a joint.  \"That hits home\\n    because it\\'s not attractive,\" he says.  \"You can\\'t be doing drugs if\\n    you want somebody to like you.\"\\n\\n\\n    Adolescents\\' choices\\n\\n    Drugs used by eighth graders in the last month:\\n                      Estimated, per 100 students\\n                             1991     1992   Pct. chg.\\n    Alcohol                  25.1     26.1        +4%\\n    Cigarettes               14.3     15.5        +8%\\n    Marijuana                 3.2      3.7       +16% \\n    Amphetamines              2.6      3.3       +27%\\n    LSD                       0.6      0.9       +50%\\n    Cocaine                   0.5      0.7       +40%\\n    Crack                     0.3      0.5       +67%\\n\\n    Source:  University of Michigan Institute for Social Research,\\n    1993 report\\n\\n\\nScott Kennedy,  Brewer and Patriot',\n",

I came \\nhome from school at 12 o\\'clock, being excused to leave before the last period \\nin order to go to Baku. When we left, everything in town was fine. Life was \\nthe same as usual, a few groups of people were discussing things, soccer and \\nother things. Then we got on the Sumgait bus bound for Baku for my first \\ncousin\\'s birthday, my father, my mother, and I. We spent the day in Baku, and \\non the 28th, somewhere around 6:00 p.m., we got on the bus for home, figuring \\nthat I\\'d have enough time to do my homework for the next day.\\n\\nWhen we were entering town, near the 12-story high-rises, our bus was stopped \\nby a very large crowd. The crowd demanded that the Armenians get off the bus. \\nThe driver says that there are no Armenians on board; then everyone on the bus\\nbegins to shout that there are no Armenians on board. The group comes up to \\nthe doors of the bus and has people get out one by one, not checking \\npassports, just going by the way people look. We get off the bus, but are not \\ntaken for Armenians.\\n\\nWe set out in the direction of home. At first we were going to go into an old \\nbuilding where we knew there\\'d be a place to hide, but the whole road was \\npacked with groups of people, all the way from Block 41 to the 8th \\nMicrodistrict. These groups were emptying people\\'s pockets and checking\\npassports. People who didn\\'t have passports with them were beaten as well.\\nThen we decided to go home instead. Near the 12-story high-rises I saw burning\\ncars and a great many people standing around the driveways, yelling. \"Death to\\nthe Armenians\" was written on the cars.\\n\\nWhen we came into the courtyard--we live in an L-shaped building--it was still\\nquiet. We went on upstairs, but didn\\'t turn on any lights. We tried to call \\nBaku to warn our relatives, who were due to arrive on Wednesday, not to come. \\nThen there was a knock at the door. It was our neighbors, who advised us to \\ncome down to stay at their place. We went down to their place, and they led us\\nto the basement. They live on the first floor and have a basement which you \\nenter across the balcony. We sat in the basement while an Armenian woman was \\nbeaten--she ran away naked. Our neighbors\\' daughter said that that\\'s right, \\nthat\\'s what the Armenians deserve, because in Stepanakert, allegedly, people \\nwere being killed, 11 girls from Agdam had been raped. We didn\\'t stay very \\nlong in the basement. We tried to support one another as best we could, \\nlooking out the small window with the iron grating. Papa watched and said \\nthings now and then. He said that there was a fire near Building 5, probably a\\ncar on fire. Then one of the groups approached our driveway and demanded that \\nthey be shown the apartments where Armenians lived. The neighbors said that \\nthere weren\\'t any Armenians here, and the group set out for the other wing of \\nthe building. They appeared from the 5/2 side of the building, where, I later \\nfound out, a woman had been murdered. The woman who ran away naked died. Yuri\\nAvakian was killed, too.\\n\\nWhen the crowd left, the neighbors said that it was all over and we could go \\nhome. We went back up to our place and again didn\\'t turn on the light. We \\nstarted to gather up our things in order to leave Sumgait for a while. We\\ntried to call a relative who lived in Sumgait, but there was no answer. We\\ndecided she had already left.\\n\\nWe sat at home. The phone rang, and the caller asked to speak with my\\nfather. I called him to the phone. It was Jeykhun Mamedov, from my father\\'s\\nwork brigade. He said he was disgusted by what was happening in our\\ntown. He asked for our address and promised to get a car and help us get\\nout of the city. To be quite honest, Papa didn\\'t want to give him our address,\\nbut my mother got on the phone and told him. Some 15 minutes after the\\ncall a crowd ran into our entryway. Bursting into the building, they broke\\ndown the door and came into the apartment . . .\\n\\nThey came straight to our apartment, they knew exactly where the Armenians \\nwere. They came into our place. We tried to resist, but there was nothing we \\ncould do. One of them took my parents\\' passports and began to read them. He \\nread the surname \"Danielian,\" turned the page, read \"Armenian,\" and that alone\\nwas enough to doom us. He said that we should be moved quickly out into the \\ncourtyard, where they would have done with us. Another, standing next to him, \\npushed some of the keys on the piano and said \"your death has tolled.\" They \\nhad knives and steel truncheons.\\n\\nI had a knife in my hand. Unfortunately, I didn\\'t use it. I just knew that if\\nI didn\\'t give up the knife things would be much worse. They struck my parents \\nand said that I should put the knife on the piano. Then, one of them commanded\\nthat we be taken outside. One person was giving orders. When we were taken \\noutdoors I went in the middle, and my mother was behind me. Someone started to\\npush her so she\\'d walk faster; I let her go ahead of me, and fell in behind \\nher. When he tried to push me, I hit him, and at that moment they began \\nbeating my parents; I realized that resistance was completely useless.\\n\\nWe are taken out into the courtyard, and the neighbors are standing on their \\nbalconies to see what will happen next. The crowd surrounds us. At first they \\nstrike me, and I\\'m knocked out; when I come to, they beat me again . . . I \\nlose consciousness often . . . I don\\'t see or hear my parents, since I was the\\nfirst one hit and was out cold. When I come to I try to pick them up; they are\\nlying next to me. The crowd is gone, the only people around are watching from \\ntheir balconies. That\\'s it. I try to pick them up, but can\\'t. My left arm is \\nbroken. I start toward the drive, wanting to tell the neighbors to call an \\nambulance. The bodies of my parents are still warm.\\n\\nWe were attacked at around 9 o\\'clock. I regain consciousness at about 11 and \\ntry to make it up the stairs home . . . When I knock at the neighbors\\' door, \\nthey push me back and tell me to go away. I go up to the third floor, our \\nneighbor puts a damp cloth on my head and says she will call an ambulance; she\\nsends her son off for one and takes me to our apartment. I often look out the \\nwindow to see if the ambulance has arrived, but I can\\'t see very far as a \\nresult of the blows, and it seems that my parents have already been taken \\naway. Then I calm down and try to convince myself that they have been taken \\naway, and everything will be OK.\\n\\nBut they were still there. Later, at 8 in the morning as I found out, the\\nambulance picked them up, but they were already dead. If they received\\nattention on time, it is possible they would still be alive. Later, around 12 \\no\\'clock on the 29th, policemen in civilian clothing come to our house with \\nsome \"assistants.\" They call an ambulance, and 20 minutes later it arrives, \\nand I am taken to the Sumgait Emergency Hospital. There they stitch the wounds\\non my head and rebind my arm. At 3 o\\'clock I and the other Armenians who are \\nin the hospital are sent by ambulance to Baku.\\n\\nIn my ward at the Sumgait Hospital there were five people, all of them\\nArmenians. The hospital was nearly overflowing with Armenians. The only\\nAzerbaijanis there were those whose car had flipped over before the events,\\nbefore the 27th.\\n\\nThen I was in the Semashko Hospital in Baku. I was there 38 days. When I was \\nreleased, on the 40th day, I found out that my parents were dead. At first \\nthey told me that they were in Moscow being treated, but later I found out \\nthat they were dead. My father\\'s older brother told me.\\n\\nMy father\\'s name was Nikolai Artemovich Danielian. He was born in 1938. My \\nmother, born in 1937, was Seda Osipovna Danielian. Papa worked at PMK-20, the \\nleader of the roofing brigade; mamma was a compressor operator.\\n\\nThey were also beaten on the head. The coroner\\'s report stated that their\\nheads were smashed open and bled profusely.\\n\\nAt the confrontation I met Jeykhun Mamedov, who had called. As it turned out \\nlater, he had been the one who tipped the crowd off. He had called \\nspecifically to find out if we were at home and to find out the exact address \\nand dispatch the group. He knew the phone number, but didn\\'t know the address.\\nBefore the events I had never seen him, but had often spoken with him on the \\nphone, when he would ask to speak with my father. I knew him by name. He \\ndenies that I was the one who answered the phone, saying that my father \\nanswered it. He denies that he called from a public phone, saying that he \\ncalled from home, which also isn\\'t true. I heard noise and the sounds of \\nautomobiles. As I later found out, earlier he had been convicted, but had \\nnever served any time--he had received a suspended sentence. He was about 20 \\nyears old. I don\\'t know if he has since confessed or not. I am sure that he \\nwas the one who tipped the crowd off. One-hundred percent sure.\\n\\nMy parents were from Karabagh. Father was from the village of Badar, and was \\ntwo years old when his family moved to Baku, where his elder brothers were to\\ngo to school. He was a student at the Naval School, but never graduated. He\\nwent off to work on the virgin lands [one of the gigantic agricultural \\nprojects instituted under Khrushchev.] When he returned he lived in Baku, and \\nlater moved to Sumgait, helping with the town\\'s construction. Mamma was from \\nthe village of Dagdagan, also from Karabagh. She worked in Sumgait, first in \\na bookstore, and later, on a construction site.\\n\\n\\nMy sister is older than I. She lives with her husband here in Karabagh. I\\nalways loved my parents. That was why I went on to 9th grade, because it\\nwas their dream that I would continue my studies. I finished 8th grade and\\nwanted to enter the Baku Nautical School, and after that, the Military\\nSchool. But later I changed my mind, or rather, my parents got me to recon-\\nsider, saying that it would be better to finish the 10th grade and then join \\nthe Naval School. I was planning to be in the Navy almost my whole life\\nlong--since childhood I had dreamed of being a sailor. My father wanted it\\nmore than anything. He always recollected his youth, telling of the School,\\nand he always said that he had made a big mistake in leaving it.\\n\\nNow I live in Karabagh and never plan to leave here. I will stay at the home \\nof my grandfather, of my ancestors, till the end of my days.\\n\\nWhile in the hospital in Baku I learned the fates of many others who had\\nsuffered as well, like Ishkhan [Trdatov]. He managed to hold them off [at\\ntheir residence in Microdistrict 3, Building 6/2, Apartment 6.] for a long\\ntime, lost his father [Gabriel], and by some miracle managed to survive. I\\nalso learned of Uncle Sasha, from Building 5/2, whose daughter was raped\\n\\n. . . Besides them, Valery--I forgot his last name--was in the hospital too,\\nabout a year younger than I, he went to School No. 14. He was riding with\\nhis parents in the car. People were throwing rocks at them, he was hit, and\\nhis parents brought him to the hospital, and he was in our ward. We even\\ncame to be friends. Before that we had just seen each other around town. But\\nin the hospital we got to know one another better. I learned of the fates of\\nothers, those who had died, or who were befallen by misfortune . . .\\n\\nToday Suren Harutunian, the First Secretary of the Communist party of Armenia,\\nwas shown on television. To be honest I am glad that Armenia agreed to \\nrecognize Nagorno Karabagh as part of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic.\\nI was repelled, no, revolted, to hear the Baku announcer who read the decision\\nof the Azerbaijani Supreme Soviet Presidium against Karabagh becoming part of \\nArmenia.\\n\\nAfter the events in Sumgait and those in Baku, the best solution is to give\\nKarabagh to Armenia, return it to Armenia, since the people want to live\\npeacefully with the Azerbaijanis, but everything has to be right before they\\ncan do that.\\n\\nI arrived in Karabagh on April 11. I felt very bad. I had constant headaches.\\nAfter a while my strength returned. My older sister, Suzanna, took me in. I \\nthink that justice should prevail; the people are demanding their due.\\n\\nYou can\\'t take away what is their due. My parents and I often spoke of Nagorno\\nKarabagh, often visited here--spent almost all of my vacations here. We had \\neven decided that if Karabagh would be made part of Armenia, we would move \\nhere for sure. We always said that the Armenian people had suffered much, and \\nthat what had been done in 1921--removing Nagorno Karabagh from Armenia--was\\nwrong. Sooner or later, mistakes should be corrected. And in order to correct \\na mistake, it must not be repeated; and the fate of all Nagorno Karabagh lies \\nin the hands of our government.\\n\\nJune 13,1988\\n\\nStepanakert \\n',\n",

As usual, Sahl\\'s was \\nindependent and sharp as a scalpel.\\n\\tMy effort can only dream of comparing favorably to Mort\\'s. At \\nleast it has a fairly popular orginating premise; everyone I\\'d mention the \\nidea to thought it was either divinely inspired or at least past due for \\ndelivery.\\n\\tThose reactions are based on parallels that should be obvious to the \\nmost peripheral observer of the Acts of those False Prophets. Both are \\nnoted for their galvanizing oratorical skills, which they both used with \\npassion to generate a political cult of massive numerical proportions (in \\nfact, Limbaugh claims to have an audience of just over 12 million, almost \\nidentical to the number of votes cast for Hitler in the April 1932 German \\nelection). Both used a myopic social perspective to build the cult, and \\nenthusiastically amputated facts from the record to fabricate their \\nideological quilt.\\n\\tThe last point is glaringly documented by passages in the opening \\npages of both books. Hitler\\'s example is when, on page 5, he claims the \\nGerman nationalist terrorist Leo Schlageter (he bombed part of a railway \\nline between Dusseldorf and Duisburg, being caught in the act, in 1923) \\nwas \"betrayed to France by a representative of his government\" when \\nthere has never been any factual foundation for such a statement.\\n\\tIn fact, the governments of both the Reich and Prussia, as well as \\nthe Vatican, actively intervened to save him from execution, and almost \\nsucceeded. Limbaugh follows suit by making the hysterically sarcastic \\nclaim in his introduction that \"in a school or during a commencement \\nceremony or many other public places... God is unconstitutional.\" Of \\ncourse, it\\'s not God but the official imposition of particular concepts of \\nGod against an individual\\'s will that\\'s unconstitutional. But Limbaugh is \\ntoo gleeful in his talent for distortion to want you to know that.\\n\\tOf course, one would assume that, by comparing the two books, \\nmy main point would be that The Way Things Ought to Be is the modern \\nAmerican Mein Kampf. Not really. At the time of the first German version \\nof Mein Kampf, Hitler was just four months out of prison (June, 1925), \\nand trying to reorganize the Nazis. He used the book to build his dozen \\nmillion followers. Limbaugh, on the other hand, came up with his book \\nafter building his dozen million. Twelve million went a longer way in \\nWeimar Germany that it does in the Republicrat United States.\\n\\tThus, the more accurate parallels would be that Limbaugh\\'s daily \\nthree-hour radio show is the American Mein Kampf, the primary \\npropoganda tool used to pump up the angry volume; and that The Way \\nThings Ought to Be is actually the American Triumph of the Will, a \\ntranslation of the same fascist message into a different medium. Also, the \\nprinted word was the more important medium in Weimar Germany, since \\nradio was still being thought of by impoverished Germans as a medium of \\nluxury in 1925. Today, on the other hand, Americans are more likely to \\nspend a few seconds to tune a radio dial at no monetary charge than drop \\n$22 for 304 pages of transcripts of the same words.\\n\\tBut, as Mort Sahl also observed on the radio the other night, some \\ncloutmeister of the radical right wants Limbaugh to be a focal point of \\ntheir propoganda. (And remember, Sahl is an Al Haig conservative these \\ndays.)\\n\\tMort might not know exactly who Rush\\'s equivalent of Rodolf \\nHess is (the book itself suggests Ed McLaughlin, the former president of \\nABC radio and now Limbaugh\\'s partner in EFM Media, the radio \\nprogram\\'s production company). But Mort himself is a veteran of the talk \\nshow, having hosted them in New York, Washington and Los Angeles. He \\nknows what evil lurks in the hearts of major market media men. He knows \\nthat Limbaugh could not have collected his audience had not the \\nopportunity been placed on a silver platter and handed to him. Limbaugh \\nearns his money just as honestly as Al Capone did; it\\'s almost worthy of a \\nRICO indictment.\\n\\tOn questions of social issues, there is an overabundance of \\nmaterial in the Limbaugh book that seems to echo Hitler\\'s venom. For \\nexample:\\n\\nOn Their Own Qualifications to Control Society\\n\\tHitler: \"Out of the host of sometimes millions of people, who \\nindividually more or less clearly and distinctly guess the truth, partly \\nperhaps understand it, one man [author\\'s emphasis] must step forward in \\norder to form, with apodeictic force, out of the wavering world of \\nimagination of the great masses, granite principles, and to take up the fight \\nfor their sole correctness, until out of the playing waves of a free world of \\nthought a brazen rock of uniform combination of form and will arises\" \\n(page 577).\\n\\tLimbaugh: \"Who needs the media when they\\'ve got me? ... The \\nshow is devoted exclusively to what I think ... [the phrase \"with half my \\nbrain tied behind my back to make it even\"] denotes the egress of mental \\naptitude I require to engage and demolish liberals and others who disagree \\nwith me ... It might take four or five years, but I\\'m convinced The Media \\nwill slowly and reluctantly come around to my way of thinking, kicking \\nand screaming all the way.\" (pages 266, 21, 299 and 273, respectively.)\\n\\nOn Religion as the Basis of a Nation\\n\\tHitler: \"In this world human culture and civilization are \\ninseperably bound up with the existence of the Aryan. His dying-off or his \\ndecline would again lower upon this earth the dark veils of a time without \\nculture ... He who dares to lay hand upon the highest image of the Lord \\nsins against the benevolent Creator of this miracle and helps in the \\nexpulsion from Paradise.\" (Page 581.)\\n\\tLimbaugh: \"America was founded as a Judeo-Christian country ... \\nBut our intellectual and political elites are often either hostile or \\nambivalent toward religion ... People for whom belief in God is at best a \\ncharming superstition have managed to ban prayer from the public schools \\nfor the last thirty years. Is it only a coincidence that the quality of \\nAmerican education has declined ever since?\" (pages 274-5.)\\n\\nOn Popular Culture as a Reason for Social Collapse\\n\\tHitler: \"The fight against the poisoning of the soul has to set in ... \\nOne has only to look at the menus of our movie houses, vaudevilles and \\ntheatres; and one can hardly deny that this is not the right kind of food ... \\nTheatre, art, literature, movies, the press, billposters and window displays \\nmust be cleaned of the symptoms of a rotting world and put into the \\nservice of a moral idea of State and culture.\" (pages 346 and 348.)\\n\\tLimbaugh: \"Today, Hollywood is in trouble. The reason [is] that \\nHollywood has forgotten who its audience is ... They make fun of people \\nwho believe in God. They ridicule the traditional family, heterosexuality \\nand monagamy. They disparage American heroes.\" (page 254.)\\n\\nOn the News Meida\\n\\tHitler: \"The activity of the so-called liberal press was the work of \\ngravediggers for the German people and the German Reich. One can pass \\nby in silence the Marxist papers of lies ... it\\'s task is only to break the \\npeople\\'s folkish and national spine, in order to make it ripe for the yoke of \\nslavery of international capital and its masters, the Jews.\" (Page 331.)\\n\\tLimbaugh: \"Elements of The Media have jumped on the \\nbandwagon of leftist causes. The cynical journalist of the past has been \\nreplaced in many cases by an enthusiastic cheerleader for causes ... During \\nthe Gulf war, CNN correspondent Bernard Shaw [said] CNN is a global \\nnetwork. We can\\'t take sides. Cant take sides? --- --- ---! ... If they don\\'t \\nrealize that their freedom lies in the United States of America and that \\ntherefore they should defend this nation, they are hopelessly misguided \\nand, may I suggest, flirting with megalomania.\" (pages 270 and 268.)\\n\\n*     *     *\\n\\t\\nTo continue these comparative excerpts is certainly possible, but \\nultimately too depressing to take in one reading.\\n\\tAfter putting these books down, there is one undeniable fact that \\nhaunts me.

In the 1990s, \\nRush Limbaugh is doing the very same thing: distributing hatred to \\ndepressed and frightened Americans; in turn, it is helping the American \\nradical right to maintain its power base as the 12-year nightmare of the \\nReagan-Bush era comes to an end, hoping to rebuild it into their hopes for \\nThe Fascist States of America.\\n\\tAnd if Limbaugh is not as repellant a Hitler, it is only because the \\nradical right utilizes Limbaugh as its own gateway opiate.

All of them were \\nshouting, \"There\\'s no room for Christians here!\" and \"When we finish with the \\nArmenians, we\\'ll go after the Russians!\" And some even cried Out, \"Death to \\nthe Armenians!\" Absurd rumors had been circulating about town. I became \\nfrightened. I came home, breathless, and told about everything I had seen \\ndowntown. My family couldn\\'t believe it. My father-in-law Sogomon Markovich \\nMelkumian, wasn\\'t home, he was at an Azerbaijani wedding. By eight o\\'clock he \\nreturned and had barely finished parking the car when his rear window was \\nsmashed with a rock. He got out of the car but there was no one there. Well I \\nwas telling him everything, too, and he said, \"What, is there no longer any\\ngovernment?\" That same day Igor said, \"Papa, something terrible is happening \\nin the city.\" And he said, \"We\\'ll stay at home, no one will drive us from our \\nown home.\"\\n\\nThe day passed. On February 28, that was Sunday, we didn\\'t go out. We called \\nour relatives and asked them all kinds of questions, and they all said the \\nsame thing. Sometime around evening they started smashing the car of an \\nArmenian from the neighboring building. Ira, my brother-in-law\\'s wife, and I \\ncalled the police: they\\'re wrecking a car, help. We called and called, and \\nnonetheless they didn\\'t come and they didn\\'t do anything.\\n\\nOn February 29, on Monday, even though there were troops in the city, we were \\nafraid to go to work. I called the school: I had the keys to the classroom. I \\ntold the senior teacher that he should send someone for the keys, I wouldn\\'t \\nbe coming in. He agreed, and even said, \"Fine, don\\'t come in, we understand \\nwhat\\'s going on in town, don\\'t come in.\"\\n\\nBefore that, on the 28th, the Ambartsumian family came over. They came to my \\nfather-in-law and said, \"Uncle Sergey, they broke our windows, bad things are \\nhappening in town.\" Uncle Misha Ambartsumian even said, \"With my own eyes I \\nsaw them chasing naked girls through the streets. I don\\'t know,\" he said, \"we \\nshould leave town.\" Well on the 29th we were already trying to decide where we \\nshould go, thinking we\\'d go to our dacha. We got a couple of bags together, \\nclothes, food, the bare essentials. And then somewhere around 4:45 the \\nbuilding manager came by and said, \"Uncle Sergey, the situation in town is \\nbad, don\\'t go out.\" My father even opened up to him and said, \"Maybe we\\'ll \\ndrive to the dacha, it\\'ll be safer there.\" \"No,\" he said, \"it\\'ll be worse \\nthere, you\\'ll be safer at home.\" He said don\\'t be afraid, if something happens \\nI\\'ll send people to save you.\\n\\nAfter he left about 15 minutes passed and about 200 people burst into our \\ncourtyard. All of us were at home at the time: Igor and I and our two \\nchildren, Ira and Edik and their daughter, my sister-in-law Ira, and my \\nmother-and father-in-law. And the Ambartsumian family, there were three of \\nthem, Uncle Misha, Zhasmen, and their daughter Marina. Now when they started\\nbreaking down the door I remember Edik and Igor told us, \"Go in that room\\nand close the door. Close the door and calm the children so they won\\'t hear\\nthat there\\'s anyone home.\" The children started crying. Suddenly Ira, my \\nbrother-in-law\\'s wife, suggested, \"Let\\'s run out onto the balcony.\" We -- the\\ntwo daughters-in-law and the children, and Zhasmen and Marina -- raced out\\nonto the balcony. My sister-in-law and my mother-in-law ran in and said, \\n\"Quick, over to the other balcony, or they\\'ll kill you all.\" We lived on the\\nsecond floor. We needed to cross over from our balcony to our neighbor\\'s. At\\nfirst we couldn\\'t manage it. The balcony looked onto the street. At that time\\npeople were coming home from work, and many just stood there, watching. I \\npleaded and begged: \"Please, call someone, have someone come!\" I even started \\nshouting. \"I\\'ll throw down the children, I\\'ll throw them down, you catch them \\nand take them somewhere, so at least the children will survive.\" Either they \\nwere afraid or . . . I don\\'t know what. They looked as though they were \\nwatching a movie. Some of them started throwing stones at us. I\\'ll say it \\nagain, these weren\\'t the bandits, these were people from the other part of the \\nbuilding and from our entryway, they were just regular people, passersby. A \\nbus even stopped. I remember a man\\'s voice saying the Armenians were climbing\\nover to the other balcony. Ira, my sister-in-law, helped us get the children \\nover there. I was pregnant, about seven months pregnant. No, it wasn\\'t yet \\nseven, it was six and a half. I climbed over too. I think Zhasmen went first; \\nyou know, I just don\\'t remember it all that well. Zhasmen went first, I think, \\nand Edik\\'s wife Ira and I had the children, and they were all screaming and \\ncrying. My Kristina said, \"Mamma, don\\'t throw us over the balcony, we\\'re \\nafraid!\" Lilia was crying, and Kristina and Seryozha were crying too. Kristina \\ndidn\\'t even want to climb over. She shouted, \"I\\'m staying with Grandmother,\\nI\\'m staying with Grandma!\" She loved her grandma, more than she loved me. And \\nmy mother-in-law shouted, \"Oh no, Kristina\\'s still there, she\\'s still there, \\nsave Kristina, too!\" Ira helped us climb over, with Kristina coming last. Ira \\nhelped us and went back inside.\\n\\nWe started pounding on the neighbor\\'s balcony door. I pounded with my fist, \\nSevil, open the door, open it, please!\" She didn\\'t open it. \"No, go away, go \\nanywhere, go, I\\'m not opening the door.\" She was our neighbor, we were \\nfriends, we never refused her anything, ever! And apparently she thought we \\nwere going to break the windows, and she opened the door. She opened it and \\nsaid, \"Karina, Karina, go away, go anywhere, just don\\'t stay here, they\\'ll \\nkill us, too, because of you.\" I begged, \"Please, at least take the children, \\nwe\\'ll leave, we\\'ll go back.\" \"No,\" she said, \"you have to leave.\" Her sons ran \\nin, one had a knife. Sevil\\'s brother, he\\'s around 18, shouted at us: \"Get out \\nof here, leave, I\\'ll kill you with this knife!\" I became terrified, I took the \\nchildren and went out in the entryway and went down a few stairs. I went down \\nand heard a loudspeaker. It was in the courtyard \"The Armenians must be \\nkilled, they\\'ve taken all the best places, all the best apartments!\" One of \\nthem said, \"Let the Armenian blood flow, none of them should survive!\" When I \\nheard that I went upstairs and started knocking on doors. No one opened their \\ndoor for me! Not on the third floor, or the fourth. I couldn\\'t see Zhasmen any \\nlonger. Ira came upstairs later. I even thought that they had let her stay, \\nthat they would save her.\\n\\nMy head was spinning. They were killing my family, and here I was in the next \\nentryway with two children. Seryozha was four, and Kristina was five and a \\nhalf. They were crying, \"Mamma, we\\'re scared!\" They were so frightened that I \\ndidn\\'t even know how to calm them, should I try to calm them or myself? It was \\nawful. But on the third floor a man did open his door. I asked, \"Open up, let \\nme inside!\" He opened the door slightly and said, \"No!\" \"No\" and that was it! \\nHe said it so sternly: \"No!\" I went up to the fifth floor. I pounded my fists \\non the door with all my might. He opened up, the man of the house, and stood \\nthere, looking at me. I was ready to get down on my knees. I almost did get \\ndown on my knees. \"Please, I beg of you, at least take the children.\" He \\nwasn\\'t an Azerbaijani, he was a Lezgin. I don\\'t even know how, but he let me \\ninside. And when I went in, Zhasmen was already there. Two minutes hadn\\'t \\npassed when Ira and Lilia came up the stairs. Lilia was crying. He didn\\'t want \\nto open the door. And again I started pleading, \"Please, open the door, it\\'s \\nour Ira and Lilia! Open the door!\" And he said, \"No, I\\'m afraid.\" I said again \\nand again, \"Please, open the door, please!\" He looked at me. He looked at me \\nfor a long time and then opened the door after all. Ira came in with Lilia. We \\nthrew ourselves into each other\\'s arms, crying. Then the man locked us into \\nthe bathroom. We sat there for a long time. Through the door he told us, \"Calm \\nthe children, and calm yourselves down, too.\"\\n\\nCalm down? This man was hiding us, but what of our family? When I was still in \\nour apartment I had sensed that none of us would come out of this alive. I \\nsaid, \"Igor, Edik, let\\'s say farewell.\" And Edik turned around and looked at \\nme as if to say, is that some kind of joke? All the same I thought they would \\nkill all of us. Igor looked at me, too . . . But it was already too late! They \\nstarted pounding on the door, Igor was standing next to the door. Before that \\nhe had told us, \"Go lock yourselves in that room and sit tight.\" He thought we \\nwere in the room. But before we went out onto the balcony we went to them: \\n\"Edik, Igor, let\\'s say farewell.\" Igor didn\\'t think we could climb over to the \\nother balcony. And we did get over there, and I myself can\\'t believe we were \\nable to save ourselves.\\n\\nIgor put on a helmet, and Edik had his coat on, and he put on a fur hat. All \\nthe men--Igor, Edik, their father, and Misha Ambartsumian--they all stood next \\nto the door. They thought they would pound on it a while and leave. But from \\nthe other side of the door they ordered in Azerbaijani: \"Open the door!\" We \\nwere all silent, waiting. Someone outside the door said, \"They\\'re home,\\nthey\\'re in there, break down the door!\" And I remember my father-in-law \\nwhispering, \"They\\'re going to break it down now, it\\'s coming down now . . . \"\\n\\nHe had something in his hands, I think it was a knife: if they got in, we were \\ngoing to defend ourselves. In the hall near the door there were two metal \\nchair legs. From outside the door they said, \"We\\'re counting to five, open \\nup!\" But we were all quiet, we didn\\'t answer them. We made like no one was \\nhome. We figured they\\'d leave, they\\'d get tired and leave. My father-in-law \\nhad said, \"It\\'s not possible they\\'d come into my home. How can that be? \\nEveryone knows us, all of Sumgait knows our family, we are on good terms with \\neveryone.\" And indeed a day did not pass that there wasn\\'t an Azerbaijani \\nguest at our table. We had a nice dacha, everyone would get together there \\noften, Azerbaijanis liked being with us there too. But now we had to save \\nourselves, we had to flee from our own home. Ira, I remember, said, \"I\\'m not \\nleaving here, my brothers and my parents are here, I\\'m going to fight \\nalongside them.\" That\\'s just what she said. She picked up a knife and said, \\n\"If they open the door and come into the apartment then I\\'m going to fight \\nalongside my family, I\\'m not going anywhere.\"\\n\\nWe were at Sevil\\'s when they broke into our apartment. We heard fighting and \\nshouting. The noise was terrible. And when we hid upstairs on the fifth floor \\nat the Lezgin\\'s apartment, you could hear everything up there, too. Even Ira\\'s \\nvoice. I remember her calling her mother several times. She called her for a \\nlong time . . . I started pounding on the door in the bathroom: \"Open the \\ndoor, what are they doing to Ira, who\\'s shouting, that\\'s Ira shouting, that\\'s \\nher voice!\" But the Lezgin said, \"It\\'s nothing, calm down, no, it\\'s not in \\nyour apartment.\" He was lying to me so I\\'d calm down. Two hours went by and \\nthe Lezgin opened the door and said, \"Karina, Igor got away, calm down. He ran \\naway.\" He saw Igor break away and run off with his own eyes. They killed him \\noutside, next to the building.\\n\\nWhile we were in the bathroom I experienced every possible human terror. The \\nway Ira shouted! She shouted, \"Save me, Mamma, save me! . . . Mamma, Mamma!\" \\nShe repeated it several times. There was a wild din. There were very many \\npeople there, all of them shouting, all of them bellowing, howling, \\nwhistling--you just can\\'t imagine what was going on, what the roar was like.\\n\\nApparently, after they had killed Ira those murderers came into the entryway \\nwhere we were hiding and came upstairs, all the way up to the fifth floor. I \\ndon\\'t know if they were just looking for any Armenians or for us in\\nparticular, but I think they were looking for us because when we had climbed \\nover the balconies someone on the street was saying that the daughters-in-law \\nwere climbing over the balconies. And after we heard Ira we heard them coming \\nup the stairs in the entryway and hammering on the doors. I thought those were \\nour last moments, and started saying good-bye to my children, kissing them. \\nThey were sleeping. I woke them up: \"Kristina! Seryozha, wake up!\" And I tell \\nIra: \"Ira, if something happens, we\\'ll throw ourselves off the balcony.\" We \\nwere on the fifth floor. Apparently our Lezgin neighbor had opened the door \\ntoo, because later he said, \"I opened the door and told them there were no \\nArmenians inside.\" And after they all left our neighbor went out on the \\nbalcony himself to see: they were gone.\\n\\nWe weren\\'t friends with those Lezgin neighbors, we only knew each other from \\nthe building. But the people we were friends with wouldn\\'t even consider \\nhiding us.\\n\\nThe Lezgin let us out of the bathroom. They had a candle burning. He said, \\n\"Karina, there\\'re no lights on in our block.\" The whole block was dark, the \\nwhole block! It\\'s a huge block, too. The Lezgin said, \"I\\'m afraid to keep\\nyou until morning, I\\'m afraid of the neighbors, they might kill me for saving\\nyou.\" I said, \"What are you saying, we\\'ll leave now. But we can\\'t just leave\\nwith the children in the middle of the night. Give us time to find somewhere\\nelse to hide.\" He said, \"Well OK, go look.\" I asked Ira, \"Ira, do you want to\\ngo?\" Ira said, \"No, I\\'ll stay with the children, Karina.\" I said, \"Fine, then\\nI\\'ll go.\" Zhasmen and I went downstairs together. It was very dark. No one \\nwas in the courtyard. It was dark, pitch black. l was afraid to go out at \\nafter seven, Igor always met me after work and accompanied me home, I never \\nwent out alone. And now here I was out in the middle of the night and after a\\nslaughter like that, too. It was probably after eleven. Later I called the \\nboarding school and my director answered. He said, \"Karina, where are you?\" I\\ndidn\\'t know, I was calling from a public phone outside and didn\\'t know where I \\nwas. I got confused and hung up the receiver. From him I only found out what \\ntime it was, I asked him, \"What time is it?\" He said 11:20, I think, but I \\ndon\\'t really remember. So anyway Zhasmen and I went out into the courtyard. I \\nlook and see what appears to be a person not far from our apartment. And there\\nwas the smell of something burnt. I became horrified. I looked at the corpse \\nfor a long time. It was either Ira or Edik. I only saw one of them, Zhasmen \\ngrabbed my hand and squeezed it: \"Hurry up, let\\'s go . . . Hurry up, come on, \\nwhat are you turning around for?\" I turned around and saw a large truck, it \\nmust have belonged to the bandits, because they came to kill us in a truck \\nlike that. We lived in the third entryway, and that truck was next to the \\nfourth. We walked quickly, holding hands. I thought, if I go to the police \\nthen they\\'ll put me away. I couldn\\'t count on them. Before I reached the \\npolice station I saw a military vehicle. We went over and I said, \"Soldier, in \\nBlock 41, I don\\'t know if they\\'ve killed people or injured them--we need to \\nsave them!\" And he said, \"Go to the police station and tell them everything.\" \\nI said, \"I\\'m afraid to go there, I\\'m afraid of them.\" He said, \"Don\\'t be \\nafraid.\"\\n\\nWe went to the police and they wrote down the address, and the military \\nvehicle went to our building. I didn\\'t go with them, they left me at the \\npolice station. I gave the addresses of my mother and my brothers so that \\nthey\\'d rescue them, too. I didn\\'t know where they were or what had happened to\\nthem.\\n\\nAfter a while they brought my children and Ira and Lilia. First they took us \\nto the KGB, that was at two or three in the morning. Then around five they \\ntook us to the City Party Committee, and there were very many people there, \\nvery many. I was pregnant and was wearing nothing but a dress. Seryozha was \\nonly wearing a shirt, and Kristina had a little dress on. No coat, no boots, \\nnothing! And we sat there for three whole days in the City Party Committee.\\n\\nThe Lezgin had told me that Igor escaped. And I thought that he was probably \\nalive. But then after two and a half days, they took us, the Armenians of \\nSumgait, to Nasosny. On March 6 some people from the Central Committee came \\nand told us, \"Karina, Ira, we need you, come with us to the City Party \\nCommittee.\" My Mamma had come to Nasosny, and she had been looking for me for \\nsix days. Mama, my brothers, and my uncle. We went to the City Party Committee \\nand waited there in the courtyard. I was wearing nothing but a dress, and Ira \\nhad only a dress on as well. There was a strong wind on March 6. An hour went \\nby. And then one of the functionaries told us, \"Karina, Ira, gather your \\ncourage. Would you like to go to the burial?\" I said, \"What, did they really \\nkill all of them?!\" He said, \"Let\\'s look.\" He had a long list, and he started \\nreading them off: Igor Melkumian, my husband, Eduard Melkumian, my brother-in-\\nlaw, Irina Melkumian, my sister-in-law, Sogomon Melkumian, my father-in-law,\\nand Raisa Melkumian, my mother-in-law. He read off all their names and said, \\n\"Get in the car, let\\'s go to the burial.\"\\n\\nWe buried our family. I couldn\\'t believe it at the time, I couldn\\'t conceive\\nof it or imagine it . . . And even now I think how shall I explain it to my \\nchildren when they\\'re older?\\n\\nMy children were very attached to their father and their grandfather and\\ngrandmother. Kristina didn\\'t love me the way she loved her grandfather and\\ngrandmother, they spoiled her. Kristina would always announce, \"My grandma is \\nbetter than anyone!\" Now, even though she is getting used to my mother, it\\'s \\ndifficult for her, and once she told her: \"You\\'re a bad grandmother.\"\\n\\nI don\\'t know why, I asked her, \"Kristina, where\\'s Papa?\" and she said, \"They \\nkilled him.\" She knows, she understands it all. And recently I scolded\\nSeryozha severely for something, and he started shouting at me, \"When Papa \\ncomes I\\'m going to tell him everything!\"\\n\\nJuly 26, 1988\\nNairi Boarding House\\nNear the Village of Arzakan\\nHrazdan District\\nArmenian SSR\\n\\t\\t\\t- - - reference - - -\\n\\n[1] _The Sumgait Tragedy; Pogroms against Armenians in Soviet Azerbaijan,\\n    Volume I, Eyewitness Accounts_, edited by Samuel Shahmuradian, forward by\\n    Yelena Bonner, 1990, published by Aristide D.

An on-the-road rally where participants are given a set of\\n      directions and clues guiding participates around the \\n      Joliet/Plainfield area.  The object is to navigate a course\\n      based on a set of directions and clues.  Participants will\\n      be given a set of questions pertaining to the course which\\n      they must answer along the way.  Points are awarded for the\\n      number of correct answers given.  Directions will ultimately \\n      lead to an off-road area where a four-wheel drive course is \\n      set-up.  At various locations in the on-road course, check-points\\n      will be set-up where participants will be asked other questions\\n      or requested to perform some activity (e.g. tire roll, truck tow,\\n      basketball free-throw, etc.) for additional points.\\n\\n   2. An optional off-road, four wheel drive course where participants\\n      will navigate off-road trails, mud bogs and/or hill climbs.\\n      Points are awarded for successfully navigating off-road obstacles\\n      without getting stuck.  If you should get stuck (which is half\\n      the fun anyway), there will be assistance to get your vehicle\\n      unstuck so you can try it again.  The off-road course will\\n      divided up based on tire size, so stock 4x4s as well as modified\\n      4x4s can run the course.\\n     \\n  At the end of the rally, trophies will be awarded to top scoring\\n  participants.  Door prizes and dash plaques will also be given out.\\n  Food and drinks also available at the conclusion.\\n\\n* This is an organized activity sponsored by the Joliet Mud Turtles\\n  so safety and fun is our foremost concern.  All 4x4s must be\\n  street legal and have solid tow points for the off-road section\\n  of the course - we don\\'t want to have to separate someone\\'s bumper\\n  from their vehicle :) .\\n\\nThe Particulars:\\n\\n* Rally begins at Instant Replay, 2409 Plainfield Road, Joliet Il.\\n    (815)436-9382   (see map below)\\n* Registration is between 9 and 10:30 a.m.  First truck out at 10:00 a.m.\\n* Rally date is Sunday April 25th, rain or shine\\n* There is an entry fee of $10 per truck.\\n* You must have a co-driver (passengers allowed)\\n* A valid drivers license is required\\n* Suggested equipment:\\n      CB Radio\\n      Compass\\n      Tow Strap and Clevis\\n      Clip Board and Pencil\\n* No alcohol during rally\\n* For more information contact\\n   Gary (815)727-3415\\n   Tom  (815)485-9346\\n   Norm Jr. (815)741-4853\\n   Brian (708)979-6083\\n\\n\\n                                            __\\n              Instant                      /\\\\\\n      |       Replay |             |         \\\\\\n      | 1.9mi  ___   | 1.2 mi      |        North\\n      |<----->|   | <------------> |\\n Rt30 |       |___|  |             |\\n------|---------------------------------------------\\n Exit |              |             |         ^\\n 257  |              |             |         |\\n      |              |             |         |\\n      |Rt55          |Canton       |Larkin   |\\n      |              |Farm         |Ave      |\\n      |              |Rd.          |         | 3 mi.\\n      |              |             |         |\\n      |              |             |         |\\n      |                            |         |\\n      |                            |         |\\n      |       Rt80                 |         v',\n",

The FBI called 911 within 4 minutes of the fire\\'s breakout. \\nUnfortunately, dispatch of vehicles outside the Waco city limits \\nrequired approval of a deputy chief, who was not available (literally \\nout to lunch?); the 911 operator desperately called around to local \\ncommunity volunteer fire departments to get something out there. By \\nthe time trucks arrived 27 minutes later, the whole complex was aflame \\nand it was clearly too little, too late; there were just two pumpers \\nand no water supply.

In fact, it is the fact that hospitals frequently compete\\nfor physicians rather than for patients that (in part) complicates and \\nundermines a simplistic free-market analysis of the market for medical care.\\n\\n\\nOnce again, there is no evidence that this is true in regard to kidney\\ndialysis.  Although price controls have promoted an expansion of services\\nto a much greater volume of patients, RD is still a profitable service.\\nOtherwise, one would expect to see evidence of rationing rather than the\\nvast expansion that has occurred.\\n\\n\\nCan you spell \"loss leader?\"  I knew you could.  Grocery stores do not\\nattempt to make up the loss on an individual product by selling more of\\nit.  In fact, your argument above is that kidney dialysis is a loss leader \\nfor other medical treatments where lost revenue can be regained.  \\n\\nBut the evidence does not support this contention.  Rather, it appears that\\nprice controls have disciplined the market by forcing an expansion of\\nservice and development of improved lower-cost technology to provide \\ncomparable benefits.  Providers continue to profit from RD, they simply\\nmake less on each treatment than they would have if the price had \\nrisen at the rate that uncontrolled treatments have.\\n\\nThere is no question that had price controls forced the price of RD \\nsubstantially below its actual cost that some or all of the doomsday\\npredictions of free-market advocates would have been seen -- restriction\\nof service, lagging technological development, etc.  Likewise, it appears\\nthat in the VA and armed forces medical care systems, where providers \\nare government agencies, some of these negative impacts may occur.  \\n(RD patients in the VA system in Spokane, for example, must travel to\\nSeattle, 300 miles away, for treatment.)  \\n\\nThe bottom line, however, is that this is an example of government \\nintervention (of a rather extreme sort) that appears to have had beneficial\\nresults for both providers and consumers.

No, there\\'s no coverage.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is he meeting with any congress people today?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Nothing scheduled.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  There are no meetings --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  There are no congressional meetings today, \\nno.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Has the President been given any information by the \\nPentagon or reached any conclusion about the validity of this report \\nfrom Hanoi?  Any instructions to Vessey on how to deal with the \\nVietnamese on that subject?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Well, clearly, the report is the first order \\nof business.  It\\'s high on the agenda on something that they\\'ll \\ndiscuss.  I think the President and General Vessey will discuss the \\nparameters of his visit to Vietnam today, but the President hasn\\'t \\ndrawn any conclusions about the report yet.  Certainly, it\\'s \\nsomething that he wants General Vessey to talk with the Vietnamese \\nabout first.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Did the President talk with any Republican senators \\nyesterday about the stimulus package?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  He spoke with Senator Dole.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  How many times?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I believe once during the day and once last \\nnight.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What was the outcome of that?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  They\\'re continuing to work toward some kind \\nof an agreement on a jobs package.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is it your impression that Senator Dole is in any \\nway flexible on this?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Well, I think we\\'re hopeful that we\\'re going \\nto get some kind of jobs package through the Senate, and we\\'ll \\ncontinue to work with Senator Dole and others until we reach some \\nkind of an agreement.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Did they discuss the VAT tax?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I don\\'t know if that came up.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Can you check that?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Sure.\\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  So what are they -- is the President offering to \\nscale down his program -- is that what he\\'s trying to do, buy it down \\nto where Dole will sign on?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Well, he\\'s trying to protect as much of it \\nas he can.  But it\\'s important to him to get some kind of a jobs \\npackage through the Senate and through Congress now.  And as soon as \\nwe reach some conclusions on that, we\\'ll let you know.  But at the \\nmoment, he\\'s continuing to consult with members of Congress \\nincluding, obviously, Senator Dole.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is he talking to anybody else?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I don\\'t believe he talked to any other \\nRepublicans yesterday.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is he talking to anybody today?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I don\\'t think anything is scheduled, but I \\nwouldn\\'t rule it out.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  We were led to believe that the President called \\nMr. Dole on the subject of Russian aid and that Bob Dole brought the \\nconversation around to stimulus package.  Is that correct?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I think the President has contacted several \\npeople on Russian aid.  I think that it was always expected that the \\nstimulus package or the jobs package will be part of any conversation \\nhe would have with Senator Dole.  The primary objective of the \\nconversation was Russian aid.  That was the first order of business, \\nbut it was both.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  In the President\\'s mind, are they linked \\npolitically in that if the Republicans continue to reject the \\nstimulus package, he thinks it will be harder to sell Russian aid to \\nthe American people?  Has he made that argument?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I can\\'t talk about specifically what \\narguments he might have made.  The President is obviously committed \\nto both.  He liked to see a jobs package to the American people \\nfirst.  But as you know, we outlined the details of additional \\nRussian aid last night in Tokyo.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  But does the President believe that the stimulus \\npackage will make it more difficult to persuade Americans to vote for \\nRussian -- to accept a vote for Russian aid?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I think that the President is going to \\ncontinue to work to pass the stimulus package, to pass a jobs \\npackage, and we\\'re still hopeful that we\\'ll get some kind of jobs \\npackage through the Congress.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is it fair to say that the President is negotiating \\nnow with Dole?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  He\\'s discussing options with him.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  On the stimulus, is it your understanding that over \\nthe break some Democrats, themselves, have left the support that they \\nhad earlier for the package, the stimulus package?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I think we still have wide support in the \\nSenate for the jobs package.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  But specifically, that you\\'ve lost Democrats other \\nthan Shelby?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I don\\'t believe so.  There hasn\\'t been a \\nvote.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What about Kohl?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Kohl and Feingold?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  There hasn\\'t been a vote yet.  And we\\'ll \\ncontinue to work with senators to try to get a majority to try to \\nbring the package to a vote, because we believe that a majority of \\nthe members of the United States Senate support the package.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  If you\\'re weren\\'t worried about Kohl and Feingold, \\nwhy did George mention Milwaukee projects the other day?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I think George pointed out a number of \\nprojects in a number of states that stand to be funded, or to lose \\nfunding if this jobs package doesn\\'t pass.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  No Democrats.  (Laughter.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I\\'ll let you draw your own conclusions.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Does he plan to talk to Dole again today or any \\nother Republicans again today?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  There\\'s nothing specifically scheduled, but \\nagain, I wouldn\\'t rule it out.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Does he plan to put out any more press releases to \\nany other states today?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  What we\\'ve done is we\\'re in the process of \\nbreaking down the benefits of the jobs package state by state.  I \\nthink it\\'s entirely feasible that as we sort of are able to sum those \\nup, we\\'ll send out press releases to the various states that suggest \\nhow their states would benefit from this package.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Will you share those with us?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Sure.  As we did yesterday.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Do you have copies of the ones you sent --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Yes, we made those available yesterday.  And \\nwe certainly can continue to provide them today.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Dee Dee, since yesterday\\'s questions and subsequent \\nstories about the VAT, what further consideration of this issue has \\nbeen given?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Nothing\\'s changed since yesterday.  I think \\nthe President commented on it this morning to say only that it was \\nsomething he knew was being considered by the task force and that he \\nhas not made a decision on, and I don\\'t think we have anything to add \\nto that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  But he also said that business and labor groups are \\ntelling him they support it.  Can you tell us --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I think that there has been -- I\\'m not going \\nto speculate on who supports it.  I think the President said that \\nthere has been some support among business and labor groups.  I don\\'t \\nthink he said he was directly contacted by them.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Are we to take that to mean that the administration \\nhas sounded out business and labor groups on this --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I think there\\'s been plenty of public \\ndiscourse on this over the years and even recently, but I don\\'t think \\nI want to add to that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  In February, though, the President said that this \\nwas something to be considered 10 or 15 years down the road.  What \\nhas happened between then and now to cause this administration to \\nchange its mind?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I think as we said yesterday, it is \\nsomething that the working groups are looking at.  They\\'re \\nconsidering a wide variety of options on everything from funding to \\nspecific options that will be covered by the President\\'s health care \\nplan.  The President has not taken it up yet, has not made a decision \\non it.  And beyond that, I don\\'t have anything to add.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  You haven\\'t answered the question.  It wasn\\'t being \\nconsidered by anyone in the White House after the President\\'s \\ncomments in February, and George reaffirmed that in a briefing.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  And then suddenly --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What happened?\\n\\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  The working groups, as we have said \\nthroughout, we instructed to consider a wide variety of options \\nacross-the-board.  And one of the things that has been talked about \\nand that they are clearly considering is some kind of a value-added \\ntax.\\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  But the President himself took this off the table, \\nDee Dee, and suddenly it reappears.  And this goes to the credibility \\nof this administration in a way.  What has happened in the meantime?\\n\\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  The President has not looked at this, it \\nhasn\\'t been presented to him, again, yet.  The working groups are \\nlooking at it, as they\\'re looking at a wide variety of options, and \\nno decisions have been made.\\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  And it raises the question of how independently the \\ntask force is working.\\n\\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  The task force was instructed to consider \\nall options, and they\\'ve taken that mandate seriously and they\\'re \\nconsidering all options.\\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  But that\\'s not the impression that the President \\nleft in February.  The impression he left was that this was something \\nthat was long-range, to be looked at 10, 15 years down the road.  The \\nclear implication of his remarks was that this was something that was \\nnot on the table, not an option. \\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  \"If it changes I\\'ll tell you.\"\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Bring him on.\\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  And you repeatedly referred to the President\\'s \\nremarks, telling us that those were still in operation.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  It\\'s changed, and we told you.  (Laughter.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  But that\\'s what Alice Rivlin\\'s comments and Donna \\nShalala comments were about.  I mean, that seemed like an \\norchestrated effort because you have two independent Cabinet officers \\n--\\n\\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I wouldn\\'t -- no, Alice Rivlin\\'s not a \\nCabinet member, first of all.  Second of all, it was not \\norchestrated, but clearly, they both said yesterday and in the last \\ncouple of days that it\\'s something that\\'s being looked at.  We \\nconfirmed that yesterday.  And I don\\'t have anything to add to that.\\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  Is it because he has very few options?\\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  Is this something that it will be incumbent upon \\nthe task force to convince the President about?  In other words, has \\nthe President himself personally ruled it out and it\\'s now up to the \\ntask force to convince him to put it back on the table?  Or is it, in \\nfact, back on the table, having been placed there by discussions with \\nthe President?  \\n\\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  It is not the working group\\'s mission at \\nthis point to convince the President of anything.  It is their \\nmission to put before him his options and to explain the benefits and \\nthe costs and the basic pros and cons of each of those options.  I \\nthink that they will certainly present the VAT to him in that \\ncontext, and at this point he\\'s not -- that presentation has not been \\nmade, but it\\'s something that he will hear and he has not made a \\ndecision on.\\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  They will present it to him as one of his options, \\nthough he specifically ruled it out?\\n\\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Correct.\\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  Dee Dee, is this more than a trial balloon?  Is \\nthis a serious consideration that the working groups are giving to \\nthis form of taxation?\\n\\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  It\\'s simply a statement of fact.  The \\nworking groups are considering a wide variety of options on a number \\nof issues relating to health care reform.  One of the options that \\nthey\\'re looking at is the VAT. \\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  Dee Dee, when the working groups were examining \\nthis possibility, was this on the table during the same time period \\nthat you were telling us that it was not?\\n\\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I don\\'t know what the specific timing of \\ntheir drafting of options is.  I don\\'t know.\\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  Who was telling you that it was not under \\nconsideration?\\n\\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I was referring back to the President\\'s \\ncomments.\\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  Have they discovered that the sin taxes won\\'t raise \\nenough money to fund the core benefit package?\\n\\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  No, there\\'s no decisions that have been made \\non how to pay for the health care plan.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  I\\'m asking whether the projections --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  There\\'s a number of options depending on how \\nthe plan is structured.  You can\\'t decide how much the plan is going \\nto cost until you decide what the plan is going to look like.  And so \\nyou can\\'t discuss what financing options have been ruled in our out \\nuntil you know.\\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  Dee Dee, we\\'ve been told that they have a computer \\nmodels on a number of possible packages.\\n\\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Correct.  \\n\\n\\t     Q\\t  The question is whether they have now determined \\nwhether sin taxes would not produce enough money for even the barest \\nminimum package.  That is not a very difficult computation.\\n\\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  It is a question that you know that we\\'re \\nnot going to answer until -- there\\'s a number of options being \\nconsidered.  It depends on how the package is structured.  The exact \\ndetails of the package and the financing mechanisms used to pay for \\nthem are all among the decisions that have yet to be made.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  And when the President has been meeting with health \\ncare -- his health care advisors, which we are told he has been doing \\n--\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Correct.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     they have never once said to him, these are your \\nfunding options, including the VAT?  He has never heard the word VAT \\nin his --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:    I am not going to comment on the specific \\nnature of the daily -- they\\'re not daily, but the quasi-regular \\nbriefings.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Well, you have.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I have not, other than to say that he\\'s not \\nconsidered the VAT.  And I think that is a true statement.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  No, but you said that it has not been presented to \\nhim as an option.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Correct.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  That doesn\\'t mean he hasn\\'t heard about it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I\\'m not going to get into the details of \\nwhat\\'s discussed.  I think that statement stands for itself.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     specific, Dee Dee.  When you say he hasn\\'t \\nlooked at it, do you mean that he hasn\\'t looked at it in terms of \\npaying for medical coverage, or hasn\\'t looked at it in general?  \\nBecause back in Chilicothe he was very specific in defining how it \\nworks, what the advantages are, the whole thing.  It sounds like --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  But that was -- I think in Chilicothe, if \\nyou go back to his remarks there, it was a broader philosophical \\ndiscussion of the tax structure.  And I think the comments were \\ngenerally in reference to the overall economic plan.  But clearly, \\nit\\'s something that he\\'s thought about in the broad context.  I mean, \\nthat was clear in Chilicothe.  What I\\'m saying is that in the process \\nof the working groups it\\'s something that he hasn\\'t considered yet.  \\nIt\\'s something that the working groups will present to him among the \\nnumber of options, and that no decisions have been made.  And I\\'m not \\ngoing to comment any further on the details of the meetings where \\nhealth care issues are being discussed.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  It\\'s your statement from this podium that no \\ndiscussion of this has taken place.  You say that no option -- that \\nthe option has not been presented to him.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  That is correct.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Do you stand by -- does the White House still stand \\nby George\\'s statement in March that this will not be in the proposal?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  No decisions have been made.  We have \\nnothing to add to what\\'s already been said.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Let me follow up here.  Do you stand by what Rivlin \\nsaid yesterday, that if any kind of VAT were to be used or \\nconsidered, that other changes to the tax code would have to be made \\nso that it would be less regressive?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I\\'m not going to comment any further on what \\nmight happen if.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  But do you stand by the previous conversations in \\nFebruary that if there were to be a VAT, I think the President said \\nyou\\'d exclude food and energy --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I\\'m not going to comment on the specific \\nstructure of a decision that hasn\\'t been made.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Was the President aware prior to Donna Shalala\\'s \\ncomments yesterday that this was under consideration by the working \\ngroups?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I don\\'t know specifically what --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Could you check for us, because that\\'s a real \\nimportant credibility question?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Sure.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Since the task force was brought together this \\nissue has been discussed, at the beginning and throughout, as one \\nfairly painless way to raise a lot of money.  Were you all kept in \\nthe dark?  Was the Press Office kept in the dark over the past month \\nand a half when you\\'ve been denying that a VAT tax would be \\nconsidered that it was actually on the table over there as an option?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I think we\\'ve said all that we have to say.  \\nIt is something the working groups are looking at.  The President has \\nnot made a decision about it yet.  And beyond that, I have nothing to \\nadd.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Well, sorry, Dee Dee, there are still a couple of \\nquestions that we are going to have to ask because we have a problem \\nwith credibility here -- yours primarily.  What we\\'re asking is, if \\nyou all were not told at all that this thing was being considered \\nwhile you were coming out here and telling us that it was not, or if \\nit\\'s a case that you were coming out here and deliberately misleading \\nus.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I don\\'t believe that anyone has ever come \\nout here and deliberately misled you from this podium -- ever --ever.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Has anyone tried to shade it a little bit to \\nindicate something -- has anybody told anybody to come out --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  We\\'re not trying to shade answers or \\ndeliberately mislead anybody.  I\\'ve said what I have to say about \\nthis issue.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  All we were trying to find out --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I understand what you\\'re trying to find out \\nand I\\'ve given you the answers, Helen.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  We\\'re trying to find out what changed -- what made \\nit an option again.  That\\'s the --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  The working groups were given a broad \\nmandate to investigate all options, and they are doing that.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Yes, but it wasn\\'t an option before.  How can you \\ninvestigate it if the President has taken it off the table?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  It is something that they\\'re obviously \\nconsidering and the President has not made a decision on.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Yes, but he took it off the table in February.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Working groups are considering it.  They\\'ll \\npresent it to the President at some point and he\\'ll make a decision.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Why would they consider it if he has taken it off \\nthe table?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  It\\'s clearly on the table. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Yes, but he took it off the table.  Did he change \\nhis mind?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  It\\'s back on the table, Bill.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Did he change his mind?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  He said this morning that he hasn\\'t made a \\ndecision about it.  He obviously knows that it\\'s on the table.  It\\'s \\nsomething that he will look at at some and when we have a decision on \\nthis we\\'ll let you know.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  So he must have changed his mind, right?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  At some point it will be looked at.  I mean, \\n--\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Dee Dee, there\\'s like two options -- either he \\nchanged his mind or the working groups think they\\'re authority \\nexceeds the President\\'s.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  The working groups were given a broad \\nmandate to look at all options; they\\'ve done that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Are you going to put out his income tax?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Yes, there will be something available on \\nhis income tax probably later this afternoon.  His return will be \\navailable. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Will there be any kind of briefing to go through \\nit?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  No, nothing\\'s planned.  I think someone will \\nbe available, probably not in a briefing setting, but to walk you \\nthrough the questions.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  We\\'re used to be walked line-by-line through the \\npresidential tax forms.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I\\'ve seen those briefings.  (Laughter.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Could we have one?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:   No, I don\\'t think there will be any kind of \\na formal briefing, but there will be somebody available to answer \\nyour questions about it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Did they file a joint form?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Yes.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  When did he file it?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I believe it\\'s being filed today.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Dee Dee, is there going to be a backgrounder for \\nMiyazawa?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  No, there will be a readout after the \\nmeeting.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  No backgrounder today?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  No backgrounder today.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  This is complicated stuff.  We need help.  \\n(Laughter.)\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  We can\\'t give you taxes and Miyazawa all in \\none day, it\\'s too confusing.

I mean, the President supports the process that they\\'ve \\ninitiated.  But there\\'s been no change in our policy for Bosnia, \\nalthough we\\'re considering a number of options right now.  If the \\nSerbs don\\'t come back to the negotiating table, if they don\\'t sign on \\nto some kind of an agreement, we will consider additional options, \\nwhich we\\'ve been saying regularly.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  One follow-up question then?  We cannot get a \\nstraight answer from anyone in the administration.  Why do you not \\nset a deadline for the Serbs?  Can you tell us the strategic or \\ntactical reasons for not giving them a deadline to come to the table?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS.

Serbia, yes; in Bosnia, no.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I think that they\\'ve had effect in Serbia \\nand we think they\\'ve had some effect in Bosnia.  And again, I\\'ll be \\nhappy to provide somebody to walk you through the details of that, if \\nyou\\'d like.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  We would like to hear from someone who can show us \\nwhat the effect has been in Bosnia.  We had the briefing on all of \\nthe terrible things that are happening in Belgrade, but we haven\\'t \\nseen anything that indicates an impact on the fighting.  Can you \\nprovide something along those lines?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS.

MYERS:    Yes, that\\'s new money, in addition to the \\n$1.6 billion announced in Vancouver.  So I assume that you all have \\nseen the $1.8-billion package that was announced this morning in \\nTokyo by Secretary Christopher.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Isn\\'t there a concern, though, about offering \\nsomething which you have to get in Congress?  I mean, that was the \\nconcern with Vancouver; you didn\\'t want to do that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  The concern with Vancouver was to do \\nsomething immediately, which required money that was already approved \\nin the Fiscal \\'93 budget.  What we\\'re looking at now is a little bit \\nlonger-term plan to build on top of the $1.6 billion that we \\nannounced in Vancouver.  This clearly will require congressional \\napproval, or some of it will anyway, and we\\'re going to continue to \\nwork with Congress to make that happen.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  To what extent has that been vetted or agreed to by \\nCongress?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  The President has had a number of \\nconversations with members and will continue to work with them as \\nthis process moves forward.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Was Christopher able to put this package out with a \\nfair degree of understanding that you will be able to get it through \\nCongress?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  It was created in consultation with \\nCongress.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  In meeting with the law enforcement officials, is \\nthat -- does that have a set speech and a goal?  A direction?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Yes, the President will talk about -- and \\nthe law enforcement organizations are endorsing the President\\'s jobs \\npackage.  They believe particularly the summer jobs package will help \\ngive kids something to do.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Who are they?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  It\\'s members or leadership from three \\norganizations:  NAPO, which is the National Association of Police \\nOrganizations; IBPO, which is the International Brotherhood of Police \\nOrganizations, I believe; and IUPA, which is the International Union \\nof Police Associations.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Will the FBI chief be there?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS.

MYERS:  No, it will be the President and these \\nnational law enforcement organization leaders.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Does the $1.8 billion announced today include the \\n$400 million that\\'s in the FY \\'94 budget for disarmament?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  No.  The Nunn-Lugar money is separate.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  So this would be the $700 million that\\'s in the \\nbudget already, plus another $1.1 billion?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  I believe all of this is on top of the $700 \\nmillion already in the budget.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is this going to be part of the supplemental or \\nFiscal \\'94 --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  We\\'ll work with Congress on the exact \\nfunding mechanism -- on exactly how this will be paid for.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  This $1.8 billion on top of --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  On top of $700 million -- on top of the $400 \\nmillion Nunn-Lugar money we announced earlier.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  And this is what prompted the President to call Bob \\nDole -- it was on this tranche, not on the previous money he was \\ncalling Bob Dole?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  Correct.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is there a briefing on Miyazawa?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS. MYERS:  There will be a readout after the meeting \\nwith Miyazawa.

I think that\\'s interesting.  But no, we\\'re thrilled \\nby the support we\\'ve received from the national Chamber and local \\nChambers across the country and we\\'ll continue to work with them on \\nthis and other initiatives.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What\\'s the status of the President thinking about \\ngoing to this Democratic retreat?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     MS.

To that end, the Institute strives to achieve\\n  greater involvement of the intelligent, concerned lay public in \\n  questions of policy and the proper role of government.\\n    The Institute is named for Cato\\'s Letters, libertarian pamphlets\\n  that were widely read in the American Colonies in the early 18th\\n  century and played a major role in laying the philosophical foundation\\n  of the American Revolution.\\n    Despite the achievement of the nation\\'s Founders, today virtually\\n  no aspect of life is free from government encroachment.  A pervasive\\n  intolerance for individual rights is shown by government\\'s arbitrary\\n  intrusions into private economic transactions and its disregard for\\n  civil liberties.\\n    To counter that trend the Cato Institute undertakes an extensive\\n  publications program that addresses the complete spectrum of policy\\n  issues.  Books, monographs, and shorter studies are commissioned\\n  to examine the federal budget, Social Security, regulation, military\\n  spending, international trade, and myriad other issues.  Major policy\\n  conferences are held throughout the year, from which papers are\\n  published thrice yearly in the Cato Journal.\\n    In order to maintain its independence, the Cato Institute accepts\\n  no government funding.  Contributions are received from foundations,\\n  corporations, and individuals, and other revenue is generated from\\n  the sale of publications.  The Institute is a nonprofit, tax-exempt,\\n  educational foundation under Section 501(c)3 of the Internal Revenue\\n  Code.',\n",

From all I've\\nheard from my U.S. relatives, drivers esp. here in Germany are much more agg-\\nressive, but not disciplined. One of my relatives, a L.A. resident, hired a car\\nat the Nuernberg airport and went about 18 miles to our home. He said then that\\nhe grew about 1 year older during this ride and swore he'd never drive a car in\\nGermany again (this was in 1982 and he kept his promise - the situation now is\\neven worse as effect of the increased volume of traffic).\\nWhat you mean by `better disciplined' should perhaps be considered `cautious due\\nto fear': \\nWhen driving around here, you always *have* to take into consideration that the\\nmajority of the other drivers absolutely relies on you: They expect that nobody\\nfails or sleeps; many of them exploit this by driving as fast as their car can\\ngo (of course only where that is allowed, you might think - dream on :).\\nSo any mistake you make is a very high risk to your health - and if you're ex-\\nposed to such a situation from your very first day as a driver, you learn to\\nhandle it - or you lose... \\nThat's the way I and most people I know experience our traffic situation - \\nwhether you think this is pleasant or efficient is up to you; I think we handle\\na very high volume of traffic and that at high speeds with modest (compared to\\nthe volume) and decreasing rates of lethal accidents - OTOH, more and more\\npeople (esp. women) dislike driving (because they feel overtaxed and threatened)\\nand each accident is one accident too much.\\n\\n\\nBetter designed and maintained, may be - but animal fences are very rare. Auto-\\nbahnen and many other streets have guard-rails (I hope that's the right word - \\na plank made from thick steel sheet fixed on uprights; it's about 2 feet high);\\nthose guard-rails are designed for keeping vehicles on the road. Smaller animals\\ncan crawl under the plank, bigger ones can easily jump over it. The point is\\nthat esp. larger animals are very rare in Germany; they tend also to be very\\ntimid. Accidents caused by animals are a neglegible danger.\\n\\n\\nYou're right (there are speed linits even on the major part of the Autobahn) -\\nbut the attitude towards driving (see above) seems to be very similar to that\\nin Germany (I've been in France, Switzerland, Italy, Austria, Spain, Belgium,\\nthe Netherlands) - besides that, you really can't rely on the residents abiding\\nthe local speed limits. I've got quite a lot of practise (~120k miles) and I'm\\nused to travel at 130 mph (FYI, with a car even smaller than a rabbit), but I\\nconsider driving on the highways round Paris or Milano really a thrill...\\n\\n\\nSorry, but you'll find quite a lot rabbit-class-car (or even smaller, mine is a\\nPeugeot 205) owners going that fast; small cars with much HP are very `hip' over\\nhere - and most people buying such cars aren't afraid to let them run.\\n\\n\\nI disagree; the size or weight of a car is rather irrelevant. Formula-1 cars\\nweigh less than 700 kg and the drivers have a chance to survive accidents at\\n130 mph or higher - OTOH when crashing against a solid object at 130 mph,\\nit makes no difference whether you sit in a Porsche, a Mercedes, a tank or on\\na bicycle: Your're dead.\\n\\nBye,\\nStefan\\n---\\nStefan Dalibor (dalibor@immd3.uni-erlangen.de)\",\n",

A gun\\nmay not be the answer to each and every dangerous situation, but are you going\\nto let the politicians decide what sort of force or weapon you may use to\\ndefend yourself and your family? \\n\\nMany times a situation may be diffused by just brandishing your handgun.  If\\ncertain members of the House and Senate have their way, .25, .32, and 9mm\\nammunition will be banned for sale to anyone other than the military and law\\nenforcement departments.

       " '\\nBosnian Muslims are citizens od Bosnia-Herzegovina who identify themselves\\nwith Bosnian Muslim cultural and religious tradition.\\n\\n\\nIn Bosnia, \"Muslim\" is not merely a religious category, but an ethnic\\none as well.  Actually, here are the two contradictory arguments\\nmade by people on this subject:\\n\\n(1) There is only Serbian and Croatian nationality, and Bosnian Muslims\\n    are simply Croats and Serbs of Islamic faith.\\n\\n(2) Bosnian Muslims are a separate nationality since they do not feel\\n    themselves to be Croats nor Serbs.\\n\\nIn 1968, argument (2) was accepted by former Yugoslavia as valid,\\nand (1) was soundly rejected.  The reasons are pragmatic: even if\\nBosnian Muslims are Croats and Serbs who converted to Islam under\\nTurkish rule centuries ago, none of the present generation has any\\nclue what was their ancestor\\'s actual nationality.  In fact, although\\nBosnian Muslims have felt drawn to Croatian or Serbian national\\nallegiance, most of them feel they have a separate cultural and\\nhistoric identity.  So, arguments like \"yes, but your ancestors were\\nCroats or Serbs\" carry very little weight.  Regardless of what\\ntheir ancestors might have been, as long as Bosnian Muslims feel\\nthat they are a separate national group, that ends the debate.\\nWhat outsiders say is simply not relevant.\\n\\n\\nIn the case of former Yugoslavia, the date is 1971, when \"Muslim nationality\"\\nappeared as a census category for the first time.  This was the result\\nof a sequence of decisions over the past decade, from recognizing\\n\"Bosniaks\" as an ethnic group (1961) to February 1968 resolution (in B-H)\\ndeclaring that Muslims are a separate nation, to formal endorsement \\nof this in January 1969, and eventually to the 1971 inclusion of\\n\"Muslim nationality\" choice in census forms.\\n\\nFor comparison, in 1948 census there were three national categories\\navailable to Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina:\\n\\nSerb-Muslims:                        71,991\\nCroat-Muslims:                       25,295\\nMuslims, ethnically undeclared:     788,403\\n\\nThis clearly demonstrates that Muslims feel themselves to be their own\\nnationality.  Only a tiny minority felt able to choose Serb or Croat\\nnationality.  Census results show that Bosnian Muslims have\\nconsistently opted for a third category: in 1948 they chose \"undeclared\",\\nin 1953 they chose \"Yugoslavs\", in 1961 both \"Yugoslavs\" and \"Bosniak \\nethnic group\", and in 1971, 1981 and 1991 they chose \"Muslim nationality\".\\n\\nPerhaps the term \"Bosnian Muslim nationality\" is too confusing for\\nthe rest of the world.  But, in the present context, we ARE talking\\nabout Muslims as nationality; not as a religous group within some\\nseparate national identity.  The reasons are mostly historical and\\ncultural.  Religion plays a smaller role, as a part of culture in general,\\nbecause the area is simply not known for religious fanaticism.  Political\\nfanaticism, yes; religious fanaticism, no.  Group security and survival\\ndominate people\\'s thinking; not fine points of theology.  In fact,\\nBosnia-Herzegovina is as well known for religious tolerance in peacetime\\nas it is known for terrible carnage in wartime.',\n",

I sincerely hope that\\nthe FBI, ATF, Attorney General Janet Reno, and all others involved in\\nthis fiasco get the just punishment that they so richly deserve.\\nSomeone should pay for this needless, tragic waste of human life.\\n\\nSadly, these evil SOBs will probably never face justice.  The media\\nand the government will just whitewash this incident and chalk it\\nup as being solely David Koresh\\'s fault.  Sadder still, the American\\npeople will probably believe them.\\n\\n\\nThis is not the problem...the problem is that we have a government that\\nis becoming more tyrannical every day.  If people decide to own guns\\n*and* live in one place together then that is their prerogative.  On\\nthe other hand, if the BDs were in posession of explosives and illegal\\nguns then the government did have the right to search their compound.\\nBut, the allegations that the BDs were in posession of illegal weapons\\nhasn\\'t been proven yet, so I\\'m not going to conclude that the BDs broke\\nany laws.  David Koresh was accused of abusing children, but if this\\nis his *only* crime then the presence of the ATF can\\'t be justified.\\nThe ATF is only supposed to deal with firearms, tobacco, and alcohol\\nviolations.  ATF agents are basically cigarette cops...they should\\nstay out of other kinds of law-enforcement actions that are out of\\ntheir jurisdiction.  Better yet, they should be s**tcanned IMO.\\n\\n\\nSounds like something the SS would do.  Human life---children and adults\\nalike---should be treated with respect---even if they are \"heavily-armed\\nreligious wackos\".\\n\\nDavid Koresh\\'s lawyer seemed to think that everyone *would* come out\\npeacefully sooner or later.  The FBI and ATF had NOTHING BUT TIME ON\\nTHEIR HANDS!  Why did they have to escalate the situation and cause\\nthis senseless tragedy?  Their job is to protect the public and SAVE\\nLIVES NOT KILL PEOPLE for crying out loud.\\n\\n \\nDon\\'t be so sure about that.  I read in a newspaper today that one of the\\ncult members said that when one of the tanks went through the wall that\\nit knocked over a lantern which caused the ranch house to be caught on\\nfire.  This cult member also said that David Koresh had *no* intentions\\nof committing mass suicide.  David Koresh\\'s lawyer also confirms this.\\nTherefore, if this is true then this means that the FBI AND ATF MURDERED\\nEVERYONE IN THAT HOUSE!  Even if this is not true, the FBI and ATF still\\ndon\\'t get off the hook because they waited a damn long time to call the\\nWaco fire department.  Perhaps they wanted all these people to die.\\n\\n \\nYou\\'re wrong on several accounts.  ATF agents were adequately armed.  They\\nhad MP5s, AR-15s, and shotguns.  Some agents were armed with automatic\\npistols but not all were.  The ATF\\'s initial claim---which they later\\nretracted---that agents were underarmed is simply ludicrous.\\n\\n\\nGun control isn\\'t the only issue here.  If the sick little monkeys in\\nWashington try to use the Waco incident as a reason to ban guns then\\nthey will have demonstrated just how f***ed up they are.  What concerns\\nme much more than new gun control legislation is that the government\\nseems to be able to get away with s**t like they did in Waco...they are\\nbecoming more and more callous about people\\'s rights and the law.

       " 'In responding to the post below I have considered issues far outside the\\nscope of revisionism and principally have considered the political\\nimplications of a racist ideology and its inevitable outcome. Thus it\\nis tangentially relevant to soc.history and alt.revisionism but I have directed\\nfollowups to t.p.m since it is principally consideration of the political\\nlessons to be drawn from the history of the NAZI party that I deal with.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLet us assume for the sake of argument that this was indeed the case? Does\\nthis mean that Hilter would have been in any way less guilty of mass murder\\nbecause he aquiesced rather than participated as an active and ardent\\nsupporter?\\n\\nOne of the important things to realise about the NAZIs is that the system\\nwas far more evil than any single member. Once created the NAZI party\\nitself was a murder machine that would inevitably commit genocide, there was\\nnoone within it strong enough to prevent it. Remember that Hitler did not\\noriginaly lead the NAZI party nor was he particularly powerful within it\\nuntil his oratory allowed the party to come to power. Had Hitler reneged\\nupon the emotiaonal expectations which he had created within the ranks of \\nhis supporters he would have been replaced as he had himself replaced the\\nold guard who he beleived were unable to grasp the intellectual implications\\nof their rhetoric. \\n\\nThis is why all parties that espouse NAZI style race supremacy ideologies must\\nbe considered as dangerous and as evil as the NAZIs. The idea that one \"race\"\\nof people is inherently superior to another and that the greatest goal of\\nhumanity is to achieve racial perfection has only one logical outcome,\\nthe gas chambers of Auschwitz.\\n\\nThe NAZI party is not simply the tale of a supremely evil single man who\\nlead an entire country astray, beyond the evil of individuals there was the\\nevil of the system itself which was self generating and self perpetuating.\\nHitler was an extreemly evil person who built his party arround an ego\\ncult centered on the demonstration of his own power, this does not however\\nmean that he was as entirely free from political constraints as he and\\nhis propagandists worked so hard to assert. The myth that racism can\\nproduce a strong government that can cure a nations ills must be \\nemphatically rejected. In the same way we must accept a distinction between\\na govenrment that demonstrates its strength and one that is able to \\ngovern decisively in the manner it beleives is best. I would accept only the\\nlatter as a \"strong\" government since most displays of strength are made\\nnecessary by an essential weakness.\\n\\nIt is important to understand that the NAZIs were not stupid nor were they\\namoral in the sense that they lacked moral scruples. They acted in the\\nsame manner as the Spanish Inquisition - murder and torture in the cause\\nof morality. The fault of the NAZIs lies in their axioms, not in their\\nlogic nor in their implementation of those axioms. Thus all such parties\\nsuch as the National Front or David Dukes Klu Klux Klan front who assert\\nthe truth of those axioms must be considered for what they are, advocates\\nof a system that would commit genocide. \\n\\nThe conclusion that Hitler was not only responsible but imensely evil is\\ninescapable from the historical record. It is important though to not let\\nthe conclusion be reached that the NAZIs espoused a set of ideas that\\nwere basically correct but had an unfortunate proponent. The evils of\\nthe concept of race supremacy are primary. Although this most emphaticaly\\ndoes not excuse individual culpability this is nevertheless secondary.\\n\\nNo matter what the promises made by a racist, supremacist party upon \\nelection those promises will be broken as soon as circumstances permit.\\nIf this requires the replacement of the leaders that originally made\\nthe pledges, that will occur. Hatred is a supreme justifier. It also creates\\na dynamic of its own when those in government allow it reign. For many\\nin government politics is a method of providing a justification for\\ntheir own existence through a demonstration of their importance. A \\nrhetoric of hatred inevitably develops the question of action since the\\ncontinued existence of an object of hatred is inevitably a reminder of the\\nessential impotence of the politician. Thus we have the US raid on Tripoli\\nwhich has little purpose beyond a demonstration of power. It is important\\nto realise that there is no quantum jump between the politics of the right\\nand those of the extreeme right but a progression from the reinforcement\\nof popular predjudice to action being taken on the basis of that predjudice.\\nIn the same way the extreeme left trace their route to despotism through\\ntheir assertion of the subjugation of the individual to ideology.\\n\\nIt is important though that in attempting to understand the dynamics\\nof political systems that this is not used to excuse the participants. The\\nleaders of a nation take on a supreme moral burden but not only do\\nso voluntarily are required to stive to do so.

But the Nat\\'l Commission on the Causes and\\nPrevention of Violence Task Force analyzed the data and found this\\nnot to be the case.  It appeared to them that as the number of knife\\nattacks increased in relation to the number of firearms attacks\\n(which presumably happened where guns were less available to assailants),\\nthe proportion of FATAL knife attacks did NOT increase relative to the\\nproportion of gun attacks.  In fact, the reverse was true.\\n\\nWhat was found was that most homicides did not show a determination on\\nthe part of the assailant to kill.  Fatalities caused by knife tended\\nto show a single-mindedness on the part of the assailant to do grave\\nphysical injury: multiple stabs wounds, wounds concentrated about the\\nhead neck and chest, etc.  Most gun homicides did not show this\\npattern.  Rather, more fatal attacks were committed during a moment of\\nrage and not the focused intent to kill the victim.\\n\\n\\tSource: Report on Firearms and Violence\\n\\n: Then, since England != USA (my ancestors left because of the oppression) you  \\n: must compare England before strict gun laws to England after strict gun laws to  \\n: be able to draw any meaning at all.

I just sort of found\\nmyself backed into that corner over the last couple of weeks.  I\\ndon\\'t think we could ever attain the low levels of European violent\\ncrime here in the US, whether we banned guns or required every\\nlaw-abiding citizen to carry a loaded Uzi.\\n\\nOn the other hand, we can draw lessons from neighbors who are more\\nculturally similar, namely the Canadians.  In fact, an exhaustive,\\nseven-year study has already been done of the respective crime rates\\nof Vancouver, British Columbia and Seattle, Washington... cities\\nwith roughly the same population, urban economy, geography\\nand crime but with decidedly different approaches to gun control.\\n\\nIn Seattle, handguns may be purchased legally for self-defense.  After\\na 30-day waiting period, a permit can be obtained to carry a concealed\\nweapon.  The recreational use of handguns is minimally restricted.\\n\\nIn Vancouver, self-defense is not considered a valid or legal reason\\nto purchase a handgun.  Concealed weapons are not permitted.\\nRecreational uses of handguns (target shooting, collecting) are\\nregulated by the province.  Purchase of a handgun requires a\\nrestricted-weapons permit.  A permit to carry may be obtained in\\norder to transport the weapon to licensed shooting clubs.  Handguns\\ntransported by vehicle must be stored in the trunk in a locked box.\\nIn short, gun control but not unreasonably so.\\n\\nBoth cities aggressively enforce their gun laws.  Convictions for\\ngun-related offenses carry similar penalties.  The researchers\\nstudied all cases of robbery, assault (simple and aggravated),\\nburglary and homicides occurring in Seattle and Vancouver from\\n1/1/80 to 12/31/86. In defining the cases, they used the same\\nstandard: the FBI\\'s Unified Crime Report.\\n\\nResults: during the seven-year study the annual rate of robbery in\\nSeattle was found to be only slightly higher than that in Vancouver\\n(1.09 / 1.11).  Burglaries occurred at nearly identical rates (.99).\\n18,925 assaults were recorded in Seattle versus 12,034 in\\nVancouver.  The risk of being a victim of a simple assault in\\nSeattle was found to be only slightly higher than Vancouver (1.18 /\\n1.15) and the risk of aggravated assault was also slightly higher\\n(1.16 / 1.12).  However, when aggravated assaults were subdivided by\\nweapon and the mechanism of assault, a clear pattern emerged.\\nAlthough both cities reported nearly identical rates of aggravated\\nassault involving knives and other dangerous weapons, firearms were\\nfar more likely to be used in Seattle.  In fact, 7.7 times as often.\\n\\nOver the seven-year study, 388 homicides occurred in Seattle\\n(11.3 per 100,000) vs. 204 homicides in Vancouver (6.9 per 100,000).\\nAfter adjustment for differences in age and sex among the populations,\\nthe relative risk of being a victim of homicide in Seattle, as\\ncompared to Vancouver, was found to be 1.63.\\n\\nWhen homicides were subdivided by the mechanism of death, the rate\\nof homicide by knives and other weapons (excluding firearms) in\\nSeattle was found to be almost identical to that in Vancouver.\\nVirtually ALL of the increased risk of death in Seattle was due to\\na more than fivefold higher rate of homicide by firearms.  Handguns\\naccounted for roughly 85% of homicides involving firearms.  Handguns\\nwere 4.8 times more likely to be used in homicides in Seattle than\\nin Vancouver.\\n\\nThe authors of the report also investigated \"legally justifiable\"\\nhomicides (self-defense).  Only 32 such homicides occurred during\\nthe seven-year study, 11 of which were committed by police.  Only\\n21 cases of civilians acting in self-defense occurrred: 17 in\\nSeattle and 4 in Vancouver.  Only 13 involved firearms.  After\\nexcluding these cases, there was virtually no impact on these\\nearlier findings.\\n\\n-------\\n\\nThis is, I feel, a very fair report.  One might even make the\\nargument that it is biased against Canada as a whole because\\nVancouver reports annual rates of homicide two to three times\\nthat of Ottawa, Calgary and Toronto while Seattle reports\\nannual homicide rates only half to two-thirds that of NYC,\\nChicago, Los Angeles and Houston.\\n\\nCritics of handgun control always argue that limited legal access\\nto handguns will have little effect on the rates of homicide because\\npersons intent on killing others will only try harder to acquire a\\ngun or will kill by other means.  This report shows differently.\\nIf the rate of homicide in a community were influenced more by\\nthe strength of intent than by the availability of weapons, we\\ncould expect the rate of homicides by weapons other than guns to\\nbe higher in Vancouver than in Seattle.  However, during the study\\ninterval, Vancouver\\'s rate of homicide by weapons other than guns\\nwas not significantly higher than that in Seattle, suggesting that\\nfew would-be assailants switched to homicide by other methods.\\n\\nAs well, ready access to handguns for self-defense by law-abiding\\ncitizens was not endorsed in this report.  Although Seattle did\\nexperience a higher rate of firearm death for self-defense, these\\ncases accounted for less than 4% of the homicides in both cities\\nduring the course of the study period.  And, as was reported,\\nSeattle apparently didn\\'t enjoy relief from any crime category\\nover Vancouver because citizens may legally arm themselves for\\nself-defense.\\n\\n\\tHeavily quoted source: Handgun Regulation, Crime,\\n\\tAssaults, and Homicide: A Tale of Two Cities.\\n\\n\\tJohn H.

On the trip\\nback from New Orleans, we got about 30 mpg in my Integra, quite ok. Mind\\nyou, the engine revs to almost 4k at 80. The civic is markedly better\\nthan the Integra in fuel economy. 50k miles down the road, I still\\nget 35 mpg at 70-75 mph driving.\\n\\n\\n\\nNow now, you can't compare a diesel with a gasoline engine.

Hultman, AUS (Ret.),\\nsuggested \"concern that the only plausible alternative is that they\\nare intentionally attempting to foreclose the Naval Reserve\\ncomponents from maintaining even today\\'s relatively low level of\\nparticipation in their parent service\\'s Total Force of the future.\"\\n   He asked the commission \"to remove from consideration all\\nlocations without sufficient and convincing demographic data to\\nwarrant approval of the requested action.\"\\n   \"Only a few of the 56 Naval and Marine Corps Reserve\\ninstallations on this list are large enough to have a significant\\nimpact on the community, if closed,\" wrote Hultman.  \"The major\\nissue is the cumulative impact of moving or closing such a large\\npercentage of the existing locations.\"\\n   Hultman reminded the commission, \"The fact that the vast\\nmajority of the Reserve installations on this list do not come\\nclose to meeting the minimal requirements for consideration in this\\nprocess certainly supports the thesis\" that these actions are\\nsimply an attempt to foreclose a substantial role for the Navy and\\nMarine Corps Reserve.\\n   ROA also noted \"that at the end of the 1960s, when the number of\\nNaval Reservists was approximately the same as today, there were 480\\nNaval Reserve facilities.  If the Navy recommendations are\\napproved, there will be less than 200 Naval Reserve facilities.\"\\n   Facilities on the list include seven Naval Air Stations ranging\\nfrom South Weymouth, Mass., to Alameda, Calif., 28 Naval\\nReserve Centers in Macon, Ga., and Parkersburg, W.Va., to\\nMissoula and Great Falls. Mont.  Naval/Marine Corps Reserve\\nCenters include four in San Francisco, Fort Wayne, Ind.,\\nBillings, Mont., and Abilene, Texas.\\n   A major Marine Reserve Center on the list is that at El\\nToro, Calif., plus six others.\\n -30-',\n",

Congressional\\nRepublicans, in an effort to discredit the stimulus package, selected what\\nthey felt were silly sounding projects from a wish-list of POTENTIAL \\nprojects prepared by the US Mayors\\' Conference before the stimulus package\\nwas ever proposed.  (The document in question was designed to pressure the\\nWhite House to increase the size of the block grant proposal submitted\\nto Congress.  It didn\\'t work.)\\n\\nThe $2.56(?) billion proposed in the stimulus package came nowhere close\\nto covering the total estimated cost of the original wish-list.  If it\\nwere passed, communities would have to select which projects to fund and\\nat what level.\\n\\nIn the case of Spokane, Wa., Tom Foley\\'s home district, no one ever\\nexpected to be able to refurbish a local swimming pool (one of the \\nRepublicans\\' examples) FROM THE FUNDS AVAILABLE IN THE STIMULUS\\nPACKAGE since the estimated cost of doing so exceeded the total \\namount of block grant funds the city would receive from the stimulus \\npackage for ALL projects.  \\n\\nThe plan, instead, was to use the money on public housing construction\\nand remodeling to cope with a severe housing shortage.  (Yup, there are\\nplaces where that is true.)  The swimming pool improvements were near the\\nbottom of a long list of priorities prepared by the city.  The $3 million\\nor so to be received would cover only a few of the most pressing\\npriorities.\\n\\nIf the block grants are cut from the stimulus package, it is these projects\\nthat will be affected by the lack of funds.  And that is why the Clinton\\nadministration has been publicizing the issue.\\n\\nA final point.  One may or may not like community block grants.  It is\\nworth noting, however, that Congressional Republicans\\' opposition to them\\nis new.  Since the Nixon administration, Republicans have generally \\nsupported such grants as an alternative to targeted federal spending,\\narguing that local governments are far better able to determine spending\\npriorities than \"Washington bureaucrats.\"  \\n\\nIs it clear now?

This was yet another example of the American and European media\\nplaying into the hands of Iraq and its de facto allies.     The\\ndestruction of the Iraqi convoy at Mutla\\' was portrayed as an all-out\\nslaughter.  This is simply not true.  The head and tail of the convoy\\nwas bombed initially, resulting in a lot of casualties at these points. \\n Before bombers came back, most of the rest of the Iraqi soldiers fled\\non foot. \\n\\nFurthermore, your estimates of Kuwaiti war dead if Allies hadn\\'t invaded\\nis completely ridiculous.

In two weeks I will be returning to Texas (my\\nhome) from my school (BYU) in Provo, Utah.  As you can imagine, trying to\\ndrive nearly 1300 miles with a broken right ankle isn\\'t just the epitome of\\na good time.  My car does not have a cruise control, so I would have to do\\nall the pedalling (ha ha) with my messed-up ankle.\\n\\nMy question:\\nWhat is the general opinion of after-market cruise control units?  I\\nrealize that a cheap CC (cruise control) from, say, Pep Boys, isn\\'t going to\\nbe as good as a factory or professionally installed unit (if there is such a\\nthing).  And I uderstand that I probably can\\'t expect much in the way of\\naccuracy, looks and that sort of thing;  But anything\\'s gotta be better than\\ntrying to drive with a hosed ankle.\\n\\nI have a 1984 Jeep Cherokee, 4 speed, standard, 4*4, 2.5L engine with\\nkettering(sp?) ignition (y\\'know, distributor cap, rotor, that set-up--not\\nelectronic.  Maybe you could\\'ve guessed it being an \\'84, but I\\'m just trying\\nto give information as completly as I can).\\n\\nI found a CC unit for 80 bucks.  It seems to use the vehicles vacuum system \\ninstead of an electric servor/motor.  Is this good or bad?  If I did buy\\nthis CC, which vacuum hose should I tap?\\n\\nIt has two speed sensors:  One magnetic, and one that gets a signal from the \\nnegative side of the distributor, kinda like a tach pick-up, or so I\\nunderstand.  I can use either one.  Which is best?  The manual says (I read\\nit in the store today) that the magnetic/axle set-up is more accurate, but\\nharder to install.  Is there really a big difference?\\n\\nIt has a sensor for the brake pedal, just like other CCs, but does NOT have a\\nsensor for the clutch pedal.  So if I wasn\\'t paying real close attention I\\nmight push the clutch in while the cruise is trying to get the speed up.  Which\\nwould wind the engine up kinda high until I got my wits about me and turned \\nthe thing off.  I\\'m pretty coordinated, so this doesn\\'t bother me, if it\\nwere for my girlfriends car, *then* it would bother me, but I\\'m ok with it.\\n\\nThe installation also calls for an attachment to a steady-on brake signal\\nand a switched-on brake signal.  I think I can get a switched brake signal\\nfrom the correct side of the brake light blade fuse.  Am I right?  But I\\'m\\nnot sure where to get the steady-on brake signal, or, for that matter, what\\nexactly it is?  Any ideas as to what the manufaturer wants and where to get\\nit?\\n\\nI think I can figure the other things out.  Like how to hook-up the negative\\nside tach-type sensing gizmo and the cabin control unit, and the ground and\\nall that miscellaneous business.  But I need a little help with:\\n\\n\\t1.  Is it worth the money and safety risk (if any) for such a\\n\\t    device?\\n\\t2.  Is there any particularly good after-market CC?\\n\\t3.  Are \"professionally\" installed CCs signifacantly better and\\n\\t    worth the cabbage?\\n\\t4.
